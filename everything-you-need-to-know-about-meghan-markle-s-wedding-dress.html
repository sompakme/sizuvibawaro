The former Suits actress, who will exchange vows with <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry</a> in Windsor on 19 May, is likely to pull out all the stops to make hers one of the most iconic royal wedding dresses of all time - the perfect fit for a princess. The most famous dress of all is Princess Diana's grandeur gown, created by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, swiftly followed by the <a class=hm-link href=#>Duchess of Cambridge</a>'s striking Alexander McQueen lace number. Here's everything we know about Meghan's dress already...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27a98eeb520b-harry-meghan-engagged-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=exE_G6vl8yoM data-wc=12><strong>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot on 19 May</strong></p><h2>Dress fittings</h2><p id=eNcqUB5naJYl data-wc=65>According to reports, Meghan had her first wedding dress fitting at Kensington Palace in January. She flew her close friend and stylist, Jessica Mulroney, from Canada to London to help her decide which gown to wear for the big day. Following the fitting, Jessica reportedly stayed at the palace for four nights, during which time she helped Meghan pick out other outfits for future engagements.</p><p id=eZrFZbh16Hhl><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Meghan Markle's signature footwear is very different to the Kate's choice of heel!</a></p><h2>Who is the designer?</h2><p id=e9mrz8c1prs0 data-wc=84>The custom-designed gown will be this year's most sought after commission amongst the fashion elite. British fashion house <a class=hm-link href=#>Ralph and Russo</a> are currently tipped to be the dress designer - the same brand who famously created Meghan's stunning engagement gown. Fashion insiders tell HELLO! that word is that the British haute couture fashion house has won the style war. The speculation comes after bookmakers revealed in February that they've had to stop taking bets on another British designer, Alexander McQueen, as punters rushed to try their luck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b38c66e2efb7-meghan-engagement-dress-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e7b72sESnAP- data-wc=12><strong>Ralph & Russo designed the dress Meghan wore in her enagement pictures</strong></p><p id=ejR6rj7ADhYB data-wc=69>Another rumoured contender to land the coveted role is London designer <strong>Antonio Berardi</strong>. Meghan was worn the fashion house before, most poignantly in May 2017 when she cheered on Harry at the polo. It was the very first time the couple were snapped together at a public event. Her navy dress was fashion-forward, modern and feminine, featuring an elegant, double-breasted cut, a ruffled asymmetrical skirt and statement button detail.</p><p id=e8m__X7h0BWL data-wc=32><strong>Erdem</strong> is also in the running. In March, during an interview on Radio 4's Today Show,&nbsp;the creative director at Erdem&nbsp;dodged&nbsp;the question about dressing Meghan Markle for the royal wedding.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fc738c6069f2-erdem-dress-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=exnx-JQatMNY data-wc=6><strong>A model on the Erdem catwalk</strong></p><p id=eaZPmYx_SME8 data-wc=55>Presenter Nick Robinson asked the designer: “How should Meghan Markle celebrate love when she comes to choose a dress? Do you have a thought on how to capture something like that?” Erdem&nbsp;replied with “I suppose my focus has been the royal ballet” and hurried&nbsp;the conversation about&nbsp;the costumes he has been working on.</p><p id=eSuhhCisCxel data-wc=23>Nick laughed&nbsp;as he stated: “Well that is proof that it’s not only politicians who extremely dodge questions, if I may say so”.</p><p id=eCmAfM-CnAUG data-wc=37>We can throw more fuel on the fire - at the time of going to press, Erdem is taking the PR activity in-house and has appointed a brand new PR manager. Something on the horizon, we wonder?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=esPZ6W7YeQZ4 data-wc=40>It has been rumoured <a class=hm-link href=#>Meghan could wear a Burberry wedding dress</a> on her big day&nbsp;after fellow designer Henry Holland said he hoped that would be the the case. On&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Wedding Guest Extraordinaire podcast&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</strong>Henry revealed&nbsp;he’s putting his money on Christopher Bailey, Burberry’s chief creative officer of the brand.</p><h2>Victoria Beckham is not the designer</h2><p id=e_8m2jEEv_ZY data-wc=60>Last month, the Spice Girls star shut down rumours that she was designing the dress - despite Meghan wearing a beautiful knitted jumper by VB in her engagement photo shoot. "She looked absolutely beautiful in my jumper. I’m sure it will be a really fun wedding," Victoria told the Guardian. "But no, she hasn’t asked me to do the dress."</p><p id=emAIHWKLLZ6O><a class=hm-link href=#>Find out why Meghan Markle wore a suit for her first public speaking engagement</a></p><h2>Not one but two gowns</h2><p id=ehjKiTNCS-Fn data-wc=72>It's believed that the American beauty will change into a second dress for her reception, and it will likely be more informal.&nbsp;"The wedding will be split into two, much like William and Kate's," an insider told Us Weekly. "So both Meghan and Harry will have second outfits." For her 2011 wedding to Prince William, Kate slipped into a stunning sweetheart-neckline satin creation, which was designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen.</p><h2>Meghan's dream wedding dress</h2><p id=eo9ztzjJb4e_ data-wc=84>In 2016, the former actress opened up about her ideal bridal gown during the filming of her wedding scene in Suits. "Classic and simple is the name of the game, perhaps with a modern twist," she told Glamour. "I personally prefer wedding dresses that are whimsical or subtly romantic. Delphine Manivet and Christos Costarellos are faves of mine for their uniqueness and beauty. And I will always be a fan of Ellie Saab. J. Mendel is spectacular as well, especially for more structural designs."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
