Before that, she had never really contemplated how kids would impact her dynamic career in D.C., working on Presidential campaigns, legislative change, and reporting as a political strategist on CNN.&nbsp;</p><p>As it turned out, kids would change the course of Sussman's career entirely. "I started to think about what I wanted to see in the world and what position I'm in to contribute. It wasn't straight politics anymore," she explains.</p><p>The shift, alongside her interest in connecting and empowering women, led to Sussman's latest endeavor, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/she-pivots-podcast-announcement/>the She Pivots&nbsp;podcast</a>. Launching this May in partnership with Marie Claire, the series, hosted by Sussman,&nbsp;explores the journey of other successful women who have found their eventual success through bold, sometimes risky choices and non-linear career moves.&nbsp;</p><p>We sat down with the host to hear about how her vibrant but unfussy work wardrobe is the key to her high-performing workdays as she interviews subjects from her home office. Spoiler alert: she ditched stretch pants a long time ago.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cZzPiXpDRzjQ3wzgQd4fmj-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=on-her-morning-routine-3>On Her Morning Routine:</h2><p>"I get up a little bit before my kids do, and I immediately look at my phone. I know we're not supposed to do that, but I still do it anyway!&nbsp;</p><p>I know some people meditate, but I don't. Every morning, I check in with my mom and sister, my mom's group text chains, and my high school friends. Those check-ins with women who are important to me are like morning affirmations.</p><p>Then I work out, alternating with my husband on responsibilities like the kid's breakfasts, packing lunches, and getting them dressed. I work out outside, usually running, under almost any circumstances unless it's freezing, snowing, or raining. I need the air. I need to see space.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

So, I drop them off and get ready for the day."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozbFGYMTzEgFnAvVsuQ7Xj-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=on-getting-dressed-3>On Getting Dressed:</h2><p>"I put on jeans every day— pretty comfortable jeans— I ditched stretch pants as soon as I could post-pregnancy.</p><p>I will never get behind the low rise jeans trend; high rise forever— I like Mother Jeans and Veronica Beard. Having kids left my body in a different state—one that reminds me my body is now more about health, strength, and functionality and not about conforming to a trend.&nbsp;</p><p>I also like bright colors and patterns and mixing patterns alongside unexpected shapes— like Joey Wolffer's reworked neck tie blouses— but nothing fussy that I can't move around in. I don't want my clothes to hold me back from playing with my kids.</p><p>Recently, though, I've been playing with a completely monochromatic look— it's an easy uniform solution that pushes me slightly out of my comfort zone in a good way.</p><p>Also, I hate wearing socks and shoes at home. When I go out, I'll wear Dansko work clogs."</p><p>"I like to wear brands that make me feel good and have a principle behind them. I also prefer to support female-founded brands— those pieces feel like a piece of armor,&nbsp;like we're women who are all in this together.</p><p>Last summer was the first year I fit back into my pre-baby clothes. So, I'm going to be shopping in my closet a lot for summer. I have a ton of hand-me-downs from my mom and my grandmother. I think almost every day I wear something from one of them. I love giving pieces new life by wearing them in different ways.&nbsp;</p><p>My grandmother had this beautiful, long Armani jacket that she wore to my wedding. My mom just pulled it out last weekend, and I wore it over a T-shirt and jeans. It felt great."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9kMUhGTWaArEJLkL7Ln6yj-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=on-empowering-pieces-3>On Empowering Pieces:</h2><p>"I feel my best self if I'm in an outfit that only I could put together— it probably includes eclectic patterns and shapes. I almost never change my jewelry; I am usually wearing some of Kendra Pariseault's pieces, but I tend to bring in some of my grandmother's jewelry to feel powerful. I imagine the Lion King when they say, 'The ancestors are with you.'"</p><h2 id=shop-some-of-emily-apos-s-favorite-pieces-3>Shop Some of Emily's Favorite Pieces:</h2><a href=# data-model-name="Joey Wölffer Reworked Top" data-url=https://store.joeywolffer.com/collections/joey-wolffer-reworked/products/joey-wolffer-reworked-neck-tie-blouse-lindsey referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpxH5hqE7QudWPdTyJVf9X-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Joey Wölffer Reworked Top</p><a href=# data-model-name="Dansko Clog" data-url=https://tiptopshoes.com/collections/women/products/dansko-pro-black-oiled referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7DpW4Z9s38Tt26Sqe4y4GX-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Dansko Clog</p><a href=# data-model-name="Kendra Pariseault Earrings" data-url=https://www.kendrapariseaultjewelry.com/collection/when-sound-stops-studs-small referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GAusoKDLBQECLaCGWnL7TX-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Kendra Pariseault Earrings</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJ6RqLWqu81orqGZpGKyrrXLsmStoaOYtW6%2F1KyqppmeYsSmrdGsZK2nXay8s7eO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./7-words-the-royal-family-simply-won-t-say.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>7 Words the Royal Family Simply Wont Say</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-segura-wife-dad-sister-weight-loss-net-worth-height-age.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Segura Wife, Dad, Sister, Weight Loss, Net Worth, Height, Age</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
