Other birds, such as raptors, may stay in the nest for as long as 8 to 10 weeks. In contrast, precocial birds spend hardly any time in the nest and are often seen wandering in search of food alongside their parents only hours after hatching. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on nestwatch.org</a><h2>Will mom bird find a moved nest?</h2>The answer to the question of whether or not a mother bird will come back if her nest is moved is complicated.

Nests, for the birds that make them, are used for housing eggs and chicks. Once these chicks leave the nest, birds don't typically return.
