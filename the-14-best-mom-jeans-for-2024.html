But a few years on, fashion lovers have kissed goodbye to their formerly beloved skinny jeans, and made mom jeans their new normal —&nbsp;and honestly, it makes sense. Their <strong>high rise</strong> is what most people are comfortable in, these days; their slight snugness at the thigh hugs our curves without feeling restrictive; and the more relaxed tapering at the calf allows room to breathe. Plus, mom jeans’ relaxed silhouette allows you to pair them with both tight and flowy tops.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, while mom jeans typically have a similar design to one another, slight variations such as a straighter leg, a cropped length, or a specific wash may help you get the exact look you’re looking for. We spoke to six fashion experts as well as did our own research to find the best mom jeans. We looked for styles that offer <strong>inclusive sizing, high quality materials</strong>, and <strong>different washes</strong> and cuts to <strong>suit various occasions</strong> and <strong>aesthetics</strong>. Wear any single pair from this list, and we know your mom would be proud.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-levis-501-original-fit-womens-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi’s 501 Original Fit Women’s Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=levis-501-original-fit-womens-jeans style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uKeiPoq_pvxpmeHb1fy5i_rYHZ0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/levis-501-original-fit-womens-jeans-d2645639aba54616b4cef802a81b2e1e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Levi's</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>501s are classic and can last decades without needing to be replaced.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The button fly makes your life more difficult.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Levi's 501 is as classic as they come — meaning many of our real-life moms wore this style when they were our age, hence mom jeans. “Levi's 501 Original Fit Jeans are the way to go if you want a classic fit and versatility,” says style expert Katya Bychkova. “It's not your typical stretchy denim but a sturdier weave garment that improves with age. The more you wear 501s, the better they fit!” That’s something to keep in mind if you feel — as some people do —&nbsp;that the fit isn’t exactly right the first time you try these on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the button-up fly is a little annoying, we have a feeling it’ll be quickly forgiven once you see just how well these jeans will come to suit you. They’re high-waisted and straight-legged with just the right amount of tapering and come in a ton of different washes, since they’re constantly being reedited. Not only do they go with just about any outfit you can conjure up, but they’ve also been known to last for actual decades, so they’re truly one of the soundest clothing investments you can make.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23-34 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton |<strong> Inseam: </strong>26 to 32-inch |<strong> Washes: </strong>17</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-hm-slim-mom-high-ankle-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>H&M Slim Mom High Ankle Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="H&amp;amp;M Slim Mom High Ankle Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/c_JSZV2NtPKCQbZbKuwRfvwAZeU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/HM-Slim-Mom-High-Ankle-Jeans-4e153a5e67b847f38a6e7790a9532f2c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>H&M</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re made from part recycled cotton and contain spandex for stretch.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The sizing is inconsistent across washes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s hard to find a better pair of jeans for such a reasonable price — and those who have bought denim from H&M can testify that the cult Swedish brand knows exactly what it’s doing in that department. These ankle pants in particular have everything we’re looking for in a mom jean: an extra high-rise, a slim fit at the thigh, and a tapered bottom that still allows for a little breathing space around your calves. They should hit just shy of full length on taller people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These jeans are available in a great range of blue washes, plus a dark gray and a black, and their fabric is also a selling point, since they’re made from part recycled cotton as well as some spandex for stretch and comfort. These tend to run small at the waist — though less so at hip level — and sizing is pretty inconsistent between different washes, so keep all of this in mind when deciding which size to buy.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0-20 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, spandex |<strong> Inseam: </strong>27-inch |<strong> Washes: </strong>7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-moussy-vintage-moskee-tapered-hi-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Moussy Vintage Moskee Tapered-HI Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shopbop Moussy Vintage Moskee Tapered-HI Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rmFUl1QuOZzyvrnXGa29QeWNsvo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Moussy-Vintage-Moskee-Tapered-HI-Jean-6cc4fa9713b643cab02a5c7e540e25b9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’ll last you for years on end.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The cowhide leather patch makes these unsuitable for vegans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Brittany Sansone, a fashion and lifestyle influencer, is obsessed with these ‘90s-style jeans from Moussy Vintage. They’re a bit more tapered around the leg and cropped at the ankle than your average mom jean, but they totally nail the high-waist and retro style — down to the whiskered wash and the discreet distressing. As such, they’re a perfect wardrobe basic that will go with plain t-shirts just as well as they will with pretty blouses, all while adding a little understated flair to your overall look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While vegans should note that these jeans are finished with a cowhide leather branding patch at the back, this pair utilizes some of the highest quality materials —&nbsp;including the leather patch, but also the 100 percent cotton fabric. This means that these jeans are not stretchy, which is a selling point if you’re looking to keep your jeans for a long time without needing to replace them. You can definitely count on these to last you years and years after purchase, which is great news for your wallet and for the planet.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>24-31 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton |<strong> Inseam: </strong>26.5-inch |<strong> Washes: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-old-navy-high-waisted-og-loose-jeans-for-women></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Old Navy High-Waisted OG Loose Jeans for Women</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Old Navy High-Waisted OG Loose Jeans for Women" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/J1yinUdyFL2pEeTEFMRpsdXhSRM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Old-Navy-High-Waisted-OG-Loose-Jeans-for-Women-368541e004654c76af5efdf12dbb3d25.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Old Navy</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re super comfortable as well as stretchy.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The tall and petite inseams tend to sell out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite not being the most glamorous brand around, Old Navy is an all-time InStyle favorite for trusty pieces at fair prices, which cater to a wide range of body shapes and sizes. These particular mom jeans come in sizes 00 through 30, and in three lengths: regular, tall, and petite, so you’re much more likely to find your ideal fit than you are with many other brands. We have noticed that the petite and tall sizes tend to sell out, so don’t wait if your size is available.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are mom jeans through and through, though they are a little looser at the calf for those who feel more comfortable with some extra breathing space there. Other than that, these jeans are high-waisted and fitted around the butt and come in many washes to suit every style. Importantly, they’re stretchy and incredibly comfy, so jeans can once again be your casualwear staple without feeling restrictive. Oh, and we’re giving out bonus points for the brand using part recycled cotton here.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00-30 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton, spandex |<strong> Inseam: </strong>28.5 to 34.5-inch |<strong> Washes: </strong>9</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-everlane-90s-cheeky-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane '90s Cheeky Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane '90s Cheeky Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OOS9gMY_udSsiyAs9ZMt0qT8E5o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Everlane-90s-Cheeky-Jean-418c5fc001424311ac8d31a960ee5165.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re so soft and comfortable you’ll want several pairs.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The sizing can be hit or miss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The mom jean trend was pulled straight out of the 1990s, so you can pretty much guarantee that any style with the term “‘90s” in its name will hit the nail on the head in this category. “If the ‘90s were a garment, this would be it!” says SJ Adams, a designer, celebrity stylist, and personal style coach known as SJ Style Guru. “Made from premium non-stretch Japanese denim, these mom jeans give off the perfect vintage look. They come in a good range of washes and have an extra-high rise which lengthens the legs and flattens the tummy. As an extra bonus, these have a butt-boosting rear fit, giving you curves in all the right places.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sansone is also a fan of these jeans, as are hundreds of reviewers, which achieve the perfect balance of loose and fitted. Available in three inseam lengths, they’re particularly great for petite ladies who have a hard time finding jeans that don’t bunch up at the ankle. They’re also made from super soft cotton, managing the rare feat of being a very comfortable jean without the need for a little spandex in the mix. Some people find they fit true to size while others prefer to size down, but once you find the exact size for your body type, prepare to start collecting these in all the washes.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23-33 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton |<strong> Inseam: </strong>26.5 to 30.5-inch |<strong> Washes: </strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-slvrlake-grace-high-rise-wide-leg-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SLVRLAKE Grace High Rise Wide Leg Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Revolve SLVRLAKE Grace High Rise Wide Leg Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HZ34bhcdzP_siECB9B8dkiMHwMY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SLVRLAKE-Grace-High-Rise-Wide-Leg-Jeans-9b16ce5298bd41bcbec77d00e98ffc97.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The wider leg style is comfortable and on trend.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The different washes aren’t all hemmed the same way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While mom jeans are typically more tapered from the knee down, many people will find having a bit more breathing space around the calf more comfortable —&nbsp;and wider-legged styles like this one look great, too. “Mom jeans could be unflattering, but Slvrlake Grace High Rise Wide Leg Jeans hug your body all in the right spots and look fantastic,” says Bychkova. “I love mom jeans for the comfort that style provides, a perfect fade, and the overall look. This non-stretch option gets the most wear of all the mom jeans in my collection.” With a 32-inch inseam, the tallest among us should find these pants fit like a glove.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We always appreciate a jean style that comes in a wide range of washes, and Slvrlake truly delivers on that front as well. The white option is a perfect summertime pick; the black ones are ideal for work; and we just plain love the “Lovesick Blues” medium wash with its beautiful fading and whiskering. It truly doesn’t hurt that these jeans are handmade in Los Angeles from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>GOTS-certified</a> organic cotton, either. Our one note? Just pay close attention to the hem on your wash of choice, since some are classically hemmed while others are frayed, which makes for a very different look.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23-32 | <strong>Material</strong>: Cotton |<strong> Inseam: </strong>32-inch |<strong> Washes: </strong>9</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curvy-cotton-on-stretch-mom-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Curvy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cotton-On Stretch Mom Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cotton-On Stretch Mom Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TfvOEovpbcJREfjopqj7jAIpjiM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cotton-On-Stretch-Mom-Jean-4d2ac48b8bea428b9e27d9633763bbcb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cotton-On</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They come in a wide range of sizes and can be rolled up for a custom length.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The cost of the jeans doesn't cover free shipping.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are jeans for people who would rather not wear jeans if they can help it, if such a thing exists. “Personally, I love the Stretch Mom Jean from Cotton-On,” says Gabriela Rosales, a fashion stylist and founder of The Stylist Witch. “I actually don't wear jeans super often, but I have three pairs of these and find them both flattering and comfortable. Plus, they are super affordable.” As Rosales notes, these jeans are stretchy, which helps offset any discomfort you might anticipate from a more tapered style like this one, especially if you have curvy hips and/or thighs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These pants are high rise, slim at the thigh, and tapered below the knee, AKA the definition of a mom jean. We appreciate that they come in a wide range of sizes, and that they can easily be rolled up at the bottom, meaning they will fit many different body shapes. Also, Cotton-On regularly runs promotions on these jeans, so you can grab more than one pair at a time —&nbsp;handy, considering they currently come in 12 lovely washes.

To that point, many people will want to size up in these because they run small — and with their 100 percent cotton fabrication, they won’t stretch immediately.

Similarly, while we tend to think of ‘90s-style jeans as light-washed and faded, you can really embrace the ‘80s look here with the “Running Errands” dark wash, or perhaps the “What Once Was” gray.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I like the vintage look, and these Levi’s ‘80s style mom jeans are a chic choice,” says West. “They are at a great price of $108 and give the same premium design and wash you might see from other, more expensive brands.” While these aren’t designer jeans, they are still an investment, which is why it’s disappointing that they’re actually a little thin —&nbsp;with some washes showing panty lines and not holding up to machine washing as well as you might hope.

Not only is the <strong>high-waist silhouette</strong> more comfortable, but, similar to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skinny jeans</a>, it also creates the <strong>illusion of longer legs</strong>.
