If there is anything we have learned so far, it is that no one is safe from meme creators. Canadian rapper, Drake, can agree as he has been a muse for a lot of meme creators. The Drake meme has been rocking the internet for a while. Every album cover, awkward face made while sitting while watching a game, screenshot from a music video, and even simple actions like checking his phone in a club, have become a great source of inspiration for meme ideas.</p><p>Drake himself even acknowledged that he is every meme maker’s top priority during an&nbsp;interview with Instagram in 2016.</p><p>“I have become the most ‘memed’ person, asides from the Michael Jordan crying face,” Drake said. “I love that I’m the guy that doesn’t take himself too seriously. I like laughing even if it’s at my expense. It doesn’t feel like it’s necessarily malicious or hurtful stuff. I’m conscious of it.”</p><p>He added: “I enjoy it more than watching television. It brings joy to my life. I hope it brings joy to other people’s lives.”</p><p>So, do not worry about hurting the sensational Canadian rapper’s feelings. This piece will focus on the Drake memes and the top 10 best of them so far.</p><b class=lwptoc_title>Table of Content</b> <span class=lwptoc_toggle><a href=# class=lwptoc_toggle_label data-label=show>hide</a></span> <a href=#><span class=lwptoc_item_number>1</span> <span class=lwptoc_item_label>What is the Drake meme?</span></a> <a href=#><span class=lwptoc_item_number>2</span> <span class=lwptoc_item_label>Top 10 Drake memes</span></a> <a href=#><span class=lwptoc_item_number>2.1</span> <span class=lwptoc_item_label>10.

Drake is a popular rapper and singer and he has been credited for popularising singing and R&B sensibilities in hip-hop. According to Michael Arceneaux, a contributor to publications like Ebony and The Atlantic, Drake’s ‘memeability’ basically comes down to his image of nerdiness.</p><p>“I like Drake, but it’s just so easy to make fun of him,” Michael explained in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Vice</a>. “I make jokes about him being soft and being sensitive, like the Sade of rap or whatever, but I like him.</p><p>“I kinda like that he’s not so much like everybody else. Other rappers, like DMX, are far more emotional, but Drake is this kind of soft and kind of corny, goofy dude.”</p><p>A comedian, Desus, added in another interview with the same publication that Drake did not just become meme-worthy, he, instead, took advantage of the fact that he was already basically a walking viral marketing campaign for the idea of softness.</p><p>“I think Drake will ultimately go down as the GOAT [greatest of all time] rapper of social media. He started as an easy target for memes, realised the social value of being a piece of content, and started creating situations/photos that he knew social media would devour.</p><p>“The lint rolling at the Raptors game? Genius. Almost a week later and he’s still getting talked about on Twitter/Tumblr/Sportscenter/etc. He realised there’s LEVELS to this shit b and he’s utilizing it to the full extent.”</p><h2><span id=Top_10_Drake_memes>Top 10 Drake memes</span></h2><h3><span id=10_That_careful_guy>10.

It has nothing with his attitude but more to do with his looks. This Drake meme looks like the rapper is the careful type. He is not reckless and will obey the law wherever he goes.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: </strong><a title="View Top 10 Megamind memes that you can relate with" href=# rel=bookmark>Top 10 Megamind memes that you can relate with</a></p><h3><span id=9_The_bookworm>9.

Nerds are mostly known for being unstylish, unattractive or socially awkward. They are also known for being knowledgeable in various subjects, especially unpopular ones. Being unstylish, unattractive and socially awkward does not seem like Drake’s style but you would not it in the image above.</p><h3><span id=8_What_a_relief>8.

Letting out a fart you have been holding in for a while is one of the greatest reliefs of all time. This is, especially, true when you are with a love interest. You want to be on your best behaviour and letting out a smelly fart will not help your cause.</p><h3><span id=7_Stop_yelling>7.

It is annoying when you get to school and people are already yelling. You want to break someone’s head to get a little peace, especially if you have a headache from not sleeping well the previous night. This Drake meme perfectly captures the dark mood.</p><h3><span id=6_Wear_a_hand_muffin>6.

Drake’s expression in this meme perfectly captures what it feels like to take food out of a microwave without a hand muffin. The burn is just a taste of what hell fire feels like.</p><h3><span id=5_Thats_my_son>5.

Hearing their mother scream their pride in public is one of the greatest feelings in the world. You cannot help but flash all 32 teeth like Drake did in this meme. Hope you are making your mom proud.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: </strong><a title="View ‘Fuck them kids’: Michael Jordan’s moment which spurred funny internet catchphrase" href=# rel=bookmark>‘Fuck them kids’: Michael Jordan’s moment which spurred funny internet catchphrase</a></p><h3><span id=4_Aww_baby>4.

This Drake meme captures this situation hilariously. His facial expression suggests he is not a hardened thug, but a scared guy who is only robbing a store for the sake of his woman. What foolish thing have you done for love?</p><h3><span id=2_Calling_shotgun_gone_wrong>2.

According to the model, she met Drake on Instagram and they both planned to hook up. After a romantic evening, the rapper invited her to his hotel room where they had sex.</p><p>Drake reportedly wore a condom during the exercise and when they were done, he disposed of the used condom in the bathroom. The model went into the bathroom, took the trashed condom and poured the content into her private part. She screamed and Drake ran into the bathroom and he was said to have stated that he added hot sauce to the condom to kill the sperm.</p><p>The report went viral on social media and the “hot sauce” Drake meme began to circulate on all the platforms. Meanwhile, Drake has since denied the allegations.</p><h2><span id=Drake_meme_template>Drake meme template</span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.skabash.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1l38tw-999x799.jpg alt="Drake meme template" width=940 height=752 title="Top 10 popular Drake memes on the internet so far 12" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The Drake meme template refers to a Drake Hotline Bling Meme.
