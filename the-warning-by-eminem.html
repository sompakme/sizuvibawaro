Eminem stated that they had dated, which by and large the masses tend to believe.&nbsp;But conversely Carey has asserted that their relationship was more along the lines of being professional buddies.&nbsp;And her doing so is what set Slim Shady off&nbsp;in the first place. In fact he acknowledges such from the onset of “The Warning”.</p><p>And basically what he is “warning” her of is that within his possession is actual evidence that they were in fact romantically involved.&nbsp;So he is threatening to release such to the world.&nbsp;Thus the underlying, psychological implication would probably be an idea akin to Eminem perhaps still being in love with Mariah Carey.&nbsp;But this idea is more or less thrown out the window as he once again resorts to dissing the hell out of her and Cannon in a way that logically would never lead to any type of future reconciliation.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h3><p>All in all, it is pretty evident that Eminem did in fact notice the concealed shots taken at him on “Obsessed”.&nbsp;And with Slim being one of the best battle rappers and indeed loudmouths in the game, it was highly unlikely he was going to take such lying down.&nbsp;So even more so than acting as a warning, the function this track truly performs is serving as yet another chapter in Eminem vs. Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Lyrics-of-“The-Warning”-by-Eminem.png><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Quick Facts about “The Warning”</h3><p>Eminem wrote “The Warning” alongside the track’s producer, his long-established collaborator Dr. Dre.</p><p>This song made an appearance on three Billboard charts, including a couple that cater specifically to rap tunes.</p>');var c=function(){cf.showAsyncAd(opts)};if(typeof window.cf !== 'undefined')c();else{cf_async=!0;var r=document.createElement("script"),s=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];r.async=!0;r.src="//srv.tunefindforfans.com/fruits/apricots.js";r.readyState?r.onreadystatechange=function(){if("loaded"==r.readyState||"complete"==r.readyState)r.onreadystatechange=null,c()}:r.onload=c;s.parentNode.insertBefore(r,s)}; })();<p>Shady Records, Aftermath Records and Interscope Records released “The Warning” on 30 July 2009.</p><p>Mariah Carey <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>is not known</a> to have directly responded to “The Warning”.&nbsp; However, a little over a year after its release, Nick Cannon dropped his own diss track against Eminem, which is entitled “I’m a Slick Rick” (2010).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Eminem’s Beef with Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon</h3><p>Of all the feuds of Eminem’s career, this one will likely remain as the ugliest.&nbsp;It dates back to the turn of the century when Eminem and Mariah Carey were on friendly terms. In fact according to Slim Shady, they actually dated for a six months.&nbsp;But the way Mariah tells it, nothing romantic ever transpired.</p><p>Either way, their relationship apparently didn’t end on good terms, because shortly thereafter Em began referring to Carey in unflattering ways on record.&nbsp;And he continued to do so for a number of years.</p><p>Then in 2009 he not only namedropped Nick Cannon but subsequently went on to refer to Mariah as “the f***ing w*ore”.&nbsp;Now Nick Cannon was married to Mariah at the time, mind you.&nbsp;So Nick proceeded to voice his own negative opinion of Eminem and his actions.</p><p>During the following decade there were jabs thrown by both Em and Nick, but things were relatively quiet.&nbsp;Then in 2019 Cannon recounted that at the time of the aforementioned dis, he wanted to physically fight Eminem. Shortly thereafter Shady proceeded to diss both Carey and Cannon on a <a href=#>track </a>hosted by Fat Joe.&nbsp;This really sent Nick into a frenzy, in which he dropped a number of diss tracks in addition to alleging on social media that Eminem is gay.&nbsp;And as of mid-2020 some said that Cannon (and by extension Mariah) actually won the battle, as he put his rival in a position where loquacious Eminem lacked the wherewithal to respond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvNoKSemZ6eu6i%2FwKebn5mTqcBvr86mZq2glWLEor7NoqWgZZKueqa5yKecpmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tiktok-viral-raincoat-selling-out-fast-with-shoppers-saying-they-now-look-forward-to-rain-with-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>TikTok viral raincoat selling out fast with shoppers saying they now 'look forward to rain' with 2</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./russell-w-howard.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Russell W.
