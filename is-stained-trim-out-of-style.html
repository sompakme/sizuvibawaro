Mixing painted and stained trim is completely doable, as long as you keep these tips in mind.<h2>Should interior doors be painted or stained?</h2>Paint naturally allows a much wider range of colors, and a more predictable color outcome.

One way to combine stained and painted trim in the same room is to paint the trim a color other than white. You could choose a color for your trim that matches your furnishings and leave the walls white or off-white.<h2>What is the 60 30 10 decorating rule?</h2>It's a classic decor rule that helps create a color palette for a space. It states that 60% of the room should be a dominant color, 30% should be the secondary color or texture and the last 10% should be an accent.<h2>Is GREY paint going out of style?</h2>Navy and gray are on the way out<p>Yes, while gray has seen an uninterrupted reign over recent paint trends, its reign may conclude in 2022.
