Uber will not hire individuals who have been convicted of certain crimes, such as violent offenses, sexual offenses, or felony drug offenses. Other types of convictions, such as DUI convictions, may also disqualify you from being hired.

However, the severity and nature of an individual’s criminal record will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The company has a thorough and detailed background check process, which includes reviewing a candidate’s driving record, criminal history, and other relevant information.
