She attended Hollins University for her undergrad from 2003 to 2007.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How are Ashleigh and Meghan related?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hale is the daughter of Meghan's paternal half-sister, Samantha Markle, who shares the same father as the duchess.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the docuseries, Hale opens up about her upbringing. "It was agreed by everyone, by myself and my brother, to be raised by our grandparents," she explains. "So they got custody of us when I was probably around two years old. And ultimately, they did adopt us. So I was raised by my paternal grandparents—for me, they were my parents."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to the docuseries, Meghan and Hale reconnected and grew close around 2007—when Hale and her mother also reconnected—during which they often traveled together. "She takes on a lot of roles for me," Hale says of the Duchess of Sussex. "There's a sister element, there's something maternal. She's a best friend. She's kind of all the things."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She was like a little sister," Meghan affirms.</p><img alt="meghan and ashleigh pose for photo together" title="meghan and ashleigh pose for photo together" width=2122 height=1194 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/videoscreenshot-harrymeghane3episode3-20-28-1671050934.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span><p>Meghan and Ashleigh</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Why wasn't Ashleigh invited to the royal wedding?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Meghan, the palace discouraged Hale's invite because of the duchess's strained relationship with Hale's mother, who was also not invited. At the time, Samantha Markle had been publicly speaking about Meghan in a negative light to the press.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"After the news first broke [of Meghan and Harry's relationship], Samantha pretty quickly began expressing a lot of angry words about Meg towards me," Hale recalls in the third episode. "What was communicated to me was maybe some resentment. It felt like no matter what I said, her perspective didn't change and seemed to get angrier and bigger, and we stopped talking. You know, some people you just can't reason with."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite Meghan and Hale's close relationship, Meghan alleges that she was advised to not send an invitation to Hale for her and Harry's wedding.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"How do we explain that this half-sister isn't invited to the wedding, but that the half-sister's daughter is?" Meghan explains, of the palace's thinking.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The guidance at the time was to not have [Hale] come to our wedding," she continues. "I was in the car with [Harry]. I had her on speakerphone, and we talked her through what guidance we were given and why this assessment was made ... and that's painful."</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Where does their relationship stand now?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Meghan does not currently have a relationship with Hale's mother, she is still on positive terms with Hale, who has herself not been on speaking terms with her mother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Meghan also says that she wanted to shield Hale from the media attention caused by her mother, who infamously tipped off tabloids with false claims on the duchess. "Ash was put through quite a bit by the media just by association," Meghan says. "I didn't want her life to be plagued with all that drama."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ef84b592-a2b0-47e0-8e6c-e29e8d3ddc25_1619719162.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Sabrina Park" title="Headshot of Sabrina Park" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sabrina Park is a Digital Fellow at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HarpersBAZAAR.com</a> where she covers news, fashion, and culture stories.
