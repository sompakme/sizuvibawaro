However, the latest news has nothing to do with the rapper.</strong></p><p>This time around, fans want to know about his teeth as audiences remember the comedian‚Äôs teeth being a little different when he was on Saturday Night Live, with Pete boasting a gap between his front two that now seems to be closed.</p>BridTV9173The Invisible Pilot | Official Trailer | HBOhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/WyiOlwMvjqs/hqdefault.jpg979925979925center22403<figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/03/GettyImages-1357811235-797x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happened-to-pete-s-tooth-gap>What happened to Pete‚Äôs tooth gap?</h2><p>Pete‚Äôs teeth are the topic of discussion at the moment, but that isn‚Äôt really anything new as his teeth have been talked about before for other reasons, like when he wore a grill on SNL and when he began brushing his teeth in the middle of a Knicks game.</p><p>The comedian is also always smiling which automatically draws his smile to fan‚Äôs attention and they couldn‚Äôt help but notice his gap closing up over the years.</p><p>He has never fully admitted what exactly he has had done to his teeth, whether it be veneers, a whitening or tightening but he did mention in 2018 that he had ‚Äúnew teeth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>pete davidson old teeth <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oMLR0O5SHQ</a></p>‚Äî alex (@algeorgopoulos) <a href=#>March 11, 2021</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=denttv-think-he-has-had-something-done-to-his-bottom-row>DENTTV think he has had something done to his ‚Äúbottom row‚Äù</h2><p>Again, Pete has been open about getting ‚Äúnew teeth‚Äù but what that means exactly hasn‚Äôt been explained. Many fans think it‚Äôs veneers and it very much could be.</p><p>Celebrity Dentistry and DENTTV have both said they think Pete has almost definitely gotten his lower row of teeth straightened, so it makes more sense that he would get veneers rather than just close up the gap.</p><p>Veneers are incredibly expensive, but with the comedian‚Äôs impressive fortune from his career as well as his major role on SNL, he could definitely afford them. Fans also agree that he has most likely had veneers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I miss when Pete Davidson had a gap in his front teeth.
