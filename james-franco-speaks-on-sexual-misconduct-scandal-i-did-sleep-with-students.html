The 43-year-old actor faced allegations from several women who were students in his acting program. They stated that he manipulated them into believing he was not only going to teach them how to act, but he would create career opportunities, as well. However, the alleged victims claimed that instead, Franco abused his power and was sexually inappropriate. He later&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">settled a lawsuit for $2.2 million.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Franco's legal team would deny the accusations but this week, the actor addressed the controversy while visiting&nbsp;The Jess Cagle Podcast.&nbsp;He said that when the allegations first surfaced, he thought it would be best if he just kept quiet because "there were people <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">that were upset with me </a>and I needed to listen."</p><p>Larry Busacca / Staff / Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"There's a writer Damon Young and he talked about when something like this happens, the natural human instinct is to just make it stop," said Franco. "You just want to get out in front of it and whatever you have to do apologize, you know, get it done. But what that doesn't do is allow you to do the work to, and to look at what was underneath."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Whatever you did, even if it was a gaff or you said something wrong or whatever, there's probably an<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> iceberg underneath that behavior</a>, of patterning, of just being blind to yourself that isn't gonna just be solved overnight." The actor also detailed his addictions to alcohol, drugs, and sex.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It's such a powerful drug," he explained. "I got hooked on it for 20 more years. The insidious part of that is that I stayed sober from alcohol all that time. And I went to meetings all that time. I even tried to sponsor other people. So in my head, it was like, 'Oh, I'm sober. I'm living a spiritual life.' Where on the side, I'm acting out now in all these other ways, and I couldn't see it."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Over the course of my teaching, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I did sleep with students</a>, and that was wrong. But like I said, it's not why I started the school and I wasn't the person that selected the people to be in the class. So it wasn't a 'master plan' on my part. But yes, there were certain instances where, you know what, I was in a consensual thing with a student and I shouldn't have been."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Watch Franco on The Jess Cagee Podcast below.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
