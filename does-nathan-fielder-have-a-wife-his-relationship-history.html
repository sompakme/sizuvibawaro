Like most celebrities, Fielder is private but has occasionally talked about his relationships. Learn more about his relationship history.</p><h2>Does Nathan Fielder have a wife?</h2><p class=align-left>The Canadian actor was once married to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sarah Ziolkowska</a>, a children's librarian. They first met at a comedy show in Canada and got married in 2011. This happened when <i>Nathan for You</i> was still in its infancy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2221a15f2a0c3fae.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jimmy Garoppoloâ€™s girlfriend timeline: who has the player dated?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Fielder having a wife was quite a shocker, especially to his viewers, considering his on-screen persona gave off a bachelor image. For instance, in the first episode, he tells the delivery person, "Nice guys finish last."</p><p class=align-left>In another episode, he calls himself "immature and underdeveloped", since girls rejected him when he was growing up, making him nervous around women.</p><p class=align-left>When talking with<i> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The A.V. Club</a></i>, Fielder said he wasn't planning on focusing on his life outside the show. That made sense why there was no clue about his marriage throughout the series. However, he revealed that he had some parts of himself in the show's persona but exaggerated some for comedy's sake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2221a15f2a0c3fae.jpg><p class=align-left>Nathan Fielder and Sarah Ziolkowska separated in 2014. He was becoming a big name in the industry which got him too involved to realize he was hurting his relationship.</p><p class=align-left>The two finalised their divorce in April 2015 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in Los Angeles, California. Nathan Fielder never opened up about the divorce until his interview with the A.V.

He even compared the divorce with cancer, only that it was much worse.</p><h2>Was Maci Nathan Fielder's girlfriend?</h2><p class=align-left>In season four of <i>Nathan for You</i>, the actor was rumoured to have a <a href=#>romantic relationship</a> with Maci, his on-screen girlfriend, who was an escort. They went on several dates, and in some scenes, the comedian's voiceover updated the viewers about the relationship and his feelings. Season four marked the show's end, and little is known about what happened after.</p><h2>Is Nathan Fielder dating anyone?</h2><p class=align-left>The actor has been keeping his personal life off the public eye. However, he has left some clues showing he is in a relationship. In 2018, he was spotted holding hands with an unknown lady walking down Los Angeles streets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fff5351014859419.jpg><p class=align-left>In a 2017 interview with <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rolling Stone</a></i>, he admitted to dating someone, without revealing their name. Similarly, when <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">talking to <i>Vulture</i></a> in 2022, Nathan said he and his partner lived together.
