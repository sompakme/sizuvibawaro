I'm proud of my family. I'm proud of my faith, which has held things together for me when people said I wasn't in line with God. I'm proud of my friendships. Most of my friends I've known since junior high school, and they keep me grounded and call me out on my crap. I'm proud of my work and the fact that I was in a movie called Pootie Tang and I'm still around to talk about it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But to be honest with you, whenever someone says "pride," the first thing I think of is the giant rainbow flag that's always up at Fire Island [N.Y.] in June. That's where my wife, Alex, and I met [in 2006], and now we go there every summer because there's such a sense of community. It's all about being exactly who you are and embracing it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After I met Alex, I remember asking my publicist if I needed to publicly come out, and she said, "Well, everyone who you work with knows, and anyone who comes in contact with you knows. So if you want to do a big interview like, 'Hey, I'm gay,' you can, but it's probably going to happen more organically." And sure enough, it did. I was at a [marriage equality] rally in 2008, and I was put on the spot and called up onstage to say a few words. I had nothing prepared, but I'm known to wing it, so I just came out right then. And the next thing you know, it was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>on CNN</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm glad that's how it happened because it was all about acceptance. I said, "This is who I am. Why am I trying to be something else? It's making me miserable, and I deserve to be happy." We all deserve to be happy, and we're all unique, so we should celebrate that. Once I made that decision, it was so liberating. I have always been honest with my opinions in my stand-up, but finally I was able to turn it around on myself. I think it shows in my work and in all other aspects of my life too.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Wanda and Alex Sykes in 2020.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Wanda Sykes</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of my proudest moments was being <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the first Black woman</a> to host the White House Correspondents' Dinner [in 2009]. Alex had just given birth to our twins [Lucas and Olivia], so it was a crazy time and we weren't getting any sleep. But to go into that room in front of Barack Obama, the first African American president, and do my thing and then get to go back to my hotel room and hold my two babies next to my wife was pretty crazy and incredible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Motherhood</a> wasn't something I always knew I wanted though. When I was younger, for some reason I sort of always thought I would be a single mother, and then I didn't know if I would have kids at all. But after I met Alex, it was like, "Of course. Why not?" She is French, and we are very different, but I think we complement each other in all the best ways. For example, she likes to travel, and I have money. I'm probably going to get into trouble for that one. But really, we both have good hearts and always just try to do the right thing. And after 12 years of marriage, we still have so much fun, especially doing the little things like dancing around the kitchen together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As parents, we're a team. Whenever there is an area where I might be lacking, she covers me, and vice versa. We always have each other's backs, and I think that's been really huge in our relationship. Our kids are 12 now, and I am so proud when they're being kind, polite, and respectful. But mostly they speak TikTok, so I have no idea what they're saying. They're still not old enough to watch my stand-up specials, but their friends come back and tell them things they heard from their parents. So they've kindly asked me to go easy on them [in my act]. I can already see that my son is the other comedian in the family, and my daughter loves to sing and dance. I'm not encouraging any of it yet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I think that things are definitely changing for younger generations, but for people my age, most of us have had to create our own families because our real families weren't that accepting of our relationships. But Alex and I always take care of each other and our kids, and most of all, I'm incredibly proud of that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sykes is the co-creator, executive producer, and star of The Upshaws, streaming now on Netflix.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For more stories like this, pick up the June 2021 of InStyle, available on newsstands, on Amazon, and for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>digital download</a> May 21st.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9aapZ2ZXajGrLHSZq6inpVivbO1w55knqujlsY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./weirdest-laws-in-maryland.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Weirdest Laws In Maryland</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shy-glizzy-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shy Glizzy Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
