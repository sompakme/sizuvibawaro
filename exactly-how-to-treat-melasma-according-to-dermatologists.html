Sure, it may go away on its own, but there are a few products, habits, and preventative measures you can take to bring back a more even skin tone.&nbsp;</p><p>“[Melasma] is something that can come and go,” says board-certified dermatologist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Marisa Garshick</a>. “But, many people do find that it gets particularly worse during times of increased estrogen exposure, such as pregnancy, or with sun exposure.” There’s not a hard and fast “cure” to banish melasma altogether, but diligent SPF application (all day, every day), the right topical regimen, and the guidance of a great derm can help your melasma from flaring.</p><p>To get the full breakdown on exactly what melasma is, how to identify it, and how to treat melasma, keep reading. Four top dermatologists are breaking down everything you need to know.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-is-melasma><span>What Is Melasma?</span></h2><p>Let me be abundantly clear: Melasma is a skin condition—but it is by no means dangerous. “Melasma is a condition where localized pigmentation of the skin occurs, usually seen as gray–brown patches of discoloration,” says board-certified dermatologist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.unionderm.com/doctors/dr-robyn-gmyrek/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Robyn Gmyrek</a>. While there are a few factors that play into predisposition (more on that below) melasma is directly correlated to sunlight exposure and hormones. “Melasma comes after UV radiation hits the skin and causes production of a hormone called melanocyte stimulating hormone and corticotropin, which causes an increase in melanin, or pigment,” explains board-certified dermatologist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://lmmedicalnyc.com/dr-morgan-rabach/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Morgan Rabach</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aJThhkLq8dxDQGwg2SkXUn-1920-80.png><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-causes-melasma><span>What Causes Melasma?</span></h2><p>The cause of melasma is unknown, but via years of patient observation, doctors have been able to identify a handful of common denominators.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-hormonal-fluctuations><span>Hormonal Fluctuations</span></h3><p>You’ll commonly hear melasma referred to as the “mask of pregnancy” because it’s largely triggered by female hormonal fluctuations. “Hormones, specifically estrogen and progesterone, play a significant role,” says Dr. Gmyrek. “This is evident from the fact that melasma often occurs or worsens during pregnancy (known as chloasma) or while taking hormone replacement therapy or birth control pills.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-genetics><span>Genetics</span></h3><p>Family history plays a significant role—so if your mom or sister dealt with melasma, you’re more likely to be prone to flares. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31424704/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Race and skin tone</a> also plays a role, as melasma is “more common in individuals with darker skin, including those of Hispanic and Asian descent,” according to Dr. Garshick. That in mind, melasma can occur regardless of your skin tone or race. &nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

UV exposure, even when using sun protection or inside, can prompt melasma or worsen existing pigmentation.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-does-melasma-look-like><span>What Does Melasma Look Like?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VUPWyMExVrDCAqifH2z8kN-1920-80.png><p>“It most often presents symmetrically, on the forehead, cheeks, bridge of nose, upper lip and occasionally on the neck, chest and forearms,” says Dr. Gmyrek, noting that it only appears in areas that are exposed to the sun. As for color? It will likely present as a brownish-gray. “Although darker skin tones may camouflage the discoloration better, the appearance is the same across skin types and no less distressing,” adds Dr. Finney.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-to-treat-melasma><span>How to Treat Melasma</span></h2><p>Here’s the deal: We’re here to set realistic expectations. “Melasma is treatable but not curable,” notes Dr. Finney. “I tell all my patients that no matter how diligent they are with their skincare routine and sun protection, melasma will find a way to flare at times.” That doesn’t mean you’re doing something wrong—flares are just part of the chronic condition. There are a handful of ways to prevent flares, reduce their severity, and in certain cases, reduce the appearance of the pigment. Want to know what they are? Keep scrolling.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-wear-sunscreen-all-the-time><span>Wear Sunscreen—All the Time</span></h3><p>The single most important step you can take to prevent melasma is to be *extremely* diligent with sun protection. In the case of melasma, UV is the enemy. Stay out of the sun as much as possible, wear wide-brimmed <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/summer-hats/>sun hats</a>, seek shade, and never forget to reapply <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/makeup/g659/best-sunscreen-products/>sunscreen</a>. “Sunlight includes ultraviolet A, ultraviolet B, and visible light such as <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15349307%20https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32029932/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>blue light</a>, which comes from computer screens, iPads, and telephone screens,” says Dr. Gmyrek. To assure protection from all three types of light, look for a “broad spectrum” option that has an SPF of 30 or higher and iron oxide as a primary ingredient.&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 " data-url=https://www.dermstore.com/eltamd-uv-clear-broad-spectrum-spf46/11370303.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermstore.com%2Feltamd-uv-clear-broad-spectrum-spf46%2F11370303.html&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=dermstore.com data-merchant-id=204053 data-merchant-url=dermstore.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uoSHYMmwJ2bw9v4XMBY2iK-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46</p><a href=# data-model-name="Andalou Naturals Daily Shade + Blue Light Defense Facial Lotion " data-url="https://www.ulta.com/p/deep-hydration-daily-shade-blue-light-defense-spf-30-pimprod2038704?sku=2609916&cmpid=PS_Non!google!Product_Listing_Ads&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1703975963224&CAAGID=140976207810&CAWELAID=330000200003019697&CATARGETID=330000200002991481&CADevice=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw756lBhDMARIsAEI0Agm0Sgz-2OuRkruTB-IXFkyp0cpL4E2bHt_jwoZPVBJCosbIQVI6INcaAk6mEALw_wcB" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?sku=2609916&cmpid=PS_Non%21google%21Product_Listing_Ads&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&cagpspn=pla&CATCI=pla-1703975963224&CAAGID=140976207810&CAWELAID=330000200003019697&CATARGETID=330000200002991481&CADevice=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw756lBhDMARIsAEI0Agm0Sgz-2OuRkruTB-IXFkyp0cpL4E2bHt_jwoZPVBJCosbIQVI6INcaAk6mEALw_wcB&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fdeep-hydration-daily-shade-blue-light-defense-spf-30-pimprod2038704%3Fsku%3D2609916%26cmpid%3DPS_Non%21google%21Product_Listing_Ads%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dpaidsearch%26cagpspn%3Dpla%26CATCI%3Dpla-1703975963224%26CAAGID%3D140976207810%26CAWELAID%3D330000200003019697%26CATARGETID%3D330000200002991481%26CADevice%3Dc%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw756lBhDMARIsAEI0Agm0Sgz-2OuRkruTB-IXFkyp0cpL4E2bHt_jwoZPVBJCosbIQVI6INcaAk6mEALw_wcB&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=ulta.com data-merchant-id=204095 data-merchant-url=ulta.com data-merchant-network=Generic><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hh54McVgT5MxguAbPSwDtb-1920-80.png></p></a><p>Andalou Naturals Daily Shade + Blue Light Defense Facial Lotion</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-try-over-the-counter-skincare><span>Try Over-the-Counter Skincare</span></h3><p>Sunscreen is the MVP when it comes to melasma prevention, but there are a handful of products available over-the-counter that can be beneficial. “Key ingredients used for lightening include retinoids, azelaic acid, tranexamic acid, glycolic acid, kojic acid, cysteamine, and licorice root extract, many of which inhibit tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the production of melanin,” explains Dr. Garshick.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there’s <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539693/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>hydroquinone</a>—a well-known, very popular, and highly controversial agent that’s available in lower concentrations over the counter. “It suppresses melanin synthesis and has been used in the treatment of melasma for many years, she explains. “While it’s an effective treatment it should always be done under the direction and supervision of a board-certified dermatologist.” There is an increased risk for ochronosis, which is a blue-black discoloration, or paradoxical darkening.&nbsp;</p><p>The trick here is that many of the aforementioned ingredients aren’t pregnancy safe—a sizable dilemma considering melasma flares during pregnancy. At certain concentrations, however, glycolic acid and azelaic acid are a-okay. As always, make sure to consult with your board-certified dermatologist and OBGYN.&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="Phloretin CF® with Ferulic Acid"

Brighten Corrective Vitamin C Concentrate</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-avoid-unnecessarily-harsh-ingredients><span>Avoid Unnecessarily Harsh Ingredients</span></h3><p>While some melasma treatments (like glycolic acid) can be harsh on the skin, it’s best to avoid unnecessary harsh active ingredients. “If they aren’t intended to treat the melasma, they may cause additional irritation and trigger worsening hyperpigmentation,” says Dr. Garshick. “It is best to avoid applying too many products, unless under the direction of your dermatologist, given increased sensitivity can lead to worsening pigmentation.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-seek-out-prescription-medications><span>Seek Out Prescription Medications</span></h3><p>If you head to your dermatologist for treatment, their first suggestion is *likely* going to be a topical cream, the most popular of which is called TriLuma. “It combines four percent hydroquinone with a retinoid and a steroid cream,” explains Dr. Houshmand. “Strong hydroquinone creams should always be used under supervision of a medical professional because if they are used for long periods, they can actually worsen pigmentation on the skin.” Most doctors will have a cutoff period of eight to 16 weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>There is also an oral version of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32243635/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>tranexamic acid</a> (the ingredient can be found over the counter). “Traditionally it’s been used for those with increased uterine bleeding to help with clotting,” explains Dr. Garshick. However, when used off-label, it’s been shown to be helpful in the treatment of melasma. “The dosing is typically less than that used for uterine bleeding and is generally used for a few months at a time.” It should, however, be avoided in people with the tendency to clot.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-consider-in-office-treatments><span>Consider In-Office Treatments</span></h3><p>The best treatment will be decided by your doctor, but there are a handful of in-office treatments that might be useful. Microneedling, platelet-rich plasma, and low-strength chemical peels are helpful for some, while lasers can be useful for others. The latter, however, should be exercised with caution. “Patients with melasma need to know that laser light and the heat caused by energy-based treatments can often flare melasma,” says Dr. Finney. “Low energy, low density fractionated lasers that target pigment can help address the discoloration in a safe and quick manner, and can be a great way to get rid of pigment quickly.” That in mind, make sure you seek out a dermatologist focused on lasers and aesthetics.
