It happens more often than anyone would like to admit, and there is more to it than it seems.</p><h2>The call of the void: what is it?</h2><p class=align-left>First of all, the phenomenon of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">call of the void</a> should be explained. Call of the void French is l'appel du vide, which is also a common name for it.</p><p class=align-left>L'appel du vide translation is the call of the void.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d373d1f955fc699e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>After 9 months of unemployment, Nigerian lady begs for job, says she does not mind being a taxi driver</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Usually, such a feeling happens when the person is looking down from the edge of a high building, bridge, cliff, or balcony. They are admiring the view and then sense something strange - thoughts of jumping from this high place start appearing in their head.</p><p class=align-left>Call of the void l'appel du vide should not be confused with suicidal ideation, as this is a serious issue which the person should immediately get help with. It is mostly a passing feeling, and the person does not even want to jump - it is merely a thought and a temporary urge.</p><h3>Call of the void examples</h3><p class=align-left>Although this feeling is mostly known as a high place phenomenon, high places are not the only ones that can make you experience it. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This impulse</a> can also be sensed when you do other risky and dangerous things.</p><p class=align-left>Some examples include:</p><ul><li>turn the wheel and drive into traffic as you drive;</li><li>jump into the water from the bridge;</li><li>jump in front of a train or stand in subway tracks;</li><li>cut yourself as you hold a sharp object;</li><li>stick your hand into a burning fire.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4bf248407a07e763.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lady organises class for Nigerian men, teaches them how to bathe babies, change diapers, video goes viral</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d373d1f955fc699e.jpg><p class=align-left>After this occurs, the person immediately counters these sensations and tells themselves they would never do anything like this. Even though they would likely not act on their feelings, the thoughts are still there for a while.</p><h2>L'appel du vide psychology: what may cause it?</h2><p class=align-left>Studies have shown that it is rather normal in people, as even those who had never experienced suicidal thoughts have experienced those urges in one way or another.</p><p class=align-left>Jennifer Hames, who led a study on the call of the void in 2012, said that, in a way, this phenomenon is a weird way of appreciating your life, which is quite a paradox.</p><p class=align-left>During the study, out of 431 undergraduate students of Florida State University, a third reported that the phenomenon was something they have experienced. Over 50% of those who have gone through it never had suicidal tendencies. Additionally, people with higher anxiety were more likely to experience this urge.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6a3d23679bcf8c63.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ wonderful new day quotes to motivate you to do great things</span></p></a><p class=align-left>People do not know for sure what might cause it, but it is commonly believed that your brain is wired the way it triggers these thoughts in certain situations.</p><p class=align-left>However, there are some theories about possible reasons for this feeling.</p><ul><li><strong>Survival instincts. </strong>It is thought that your brain might send a signal to warn you when you are in a dangerous situation, but you might mistake this quick signal for a desire to do the opposite.</li><li><strong>Anxiety sensitivity. </strong>People who have anxiety and fear are more likely to experience this syndrome. If a person has anxiety sensitivity, it often means that the person can interpret a signal which they struggle to understand as a dangerous thing.</li></ul><h2>Should I get help?</h2><p class=align-left>Most of the time, you should not feel too concerned about experiencing this feeling.
