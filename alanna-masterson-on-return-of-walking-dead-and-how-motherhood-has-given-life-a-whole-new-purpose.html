"I think that’s what’s alsoamazing about this show, is you know, what would happen if all the things wentaway that people waste so much time thinking [about] or are important in yourlife,” Alanna says. “It makes you just kind of value every day and cherishevery day knowing that you never know what happens in life."</p><p id=ehVn7V-Mgrvo data-wc=46>The actress welcomed her firstchild with photographer boyfriend <strong>Brick Stowell</strong> back in November. Beinga mom to her 3-month-old daughter <strong>Marley</strong> she says "is probably thebest thing that has ever happened to me. It kind of gives life a whole newpurpose. I love [Marley] more than anything.”</p><p id=e5l6ABVYTaxk data-wc=46>Playing a strong female likeTara has also changed the star’s outlook on raising her daughter. She explains,"I can just continue to work hard and teach her that you can be a strongwoman when you grow up and work long hours and make a life for yourself.”</p><p id=edJg44s7t2hr data-wc=70>Making life a “joy” for herdaughter to grow up in is important for the first-time mom.

Does it still amaze you the following has? </strong>"I mean yeah,I would say on a daily basis I’m pretty shocked. I mean this is going to be oneof those shows that people talk about when I’m old. It’s not going togo away. And even when the show ends, it’s going to last."</p><p id=eOZNw6MGnSPv data-wc=71><strong>Where do you see thedirection of heading this season with your character Tara? </strong>"Especially this season, Ithink that Tara has found someone that she wants tofight for and take care of, and I think that she’s going to be just willing toprotect Alexandria to make sure that everyone is okay. With the loss of herfamily, she didn’t really have anything to kind of fight for and now she does."</p><p id=e5q4YkzIHGxa data-wc=75><strong>Can you relate to Tara?</strong>"Yeah, absolutely! I’m asuper, super optimistic person. My mom is that way – so even when times arehard and tough, you know she’s always like, ‘Hey listen, things can be worse orthis can happen or that can happen.’ Or even with acting when somethingwouldn’t work out as planned she was always like you know something else iscoming along the way, don’t you worry. I guess that’s kind of how I wasraised."</p><p id=es4Bzhs-e1jY data-wc=84><strong>There is never a shortageof deaths on this show. When a cast member gets killed off is there a goodiebag of sorts or a party you throw to bid him/her farewell?</strong>"[Laughs] A goodie bag.That would be really funny! We do all get together and have a dinner or a lunch, or we all go to a movie or something. We’re all really close. It’s prettydevastating when people leave, so we try to say goodbye in the best way possibleand not make it super sad."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0358ca622f04-body53-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eMjcxR8WqrKd data-wc=4>Photo: Frank Ockenfels 3/AMC</p><p id=e-O91hi5vKT- data-wc=78><strong>Growing up, were you everscared of zombies or vampires? Did your brothers make you watch those types ofshows?</strong>"Yeah. I remember watching[ ] and just not being able to sleep because I wasworried that someone was going to come out and pull me down. I also have fourbrothers [Danny, Chis, Jordan and Will] so I definitely saw things I probablyshouldn’t have seen as a kid. I think I watched Arachnophobia when I was 6. Ididn’t sleep for weeks."</p><p id=exC0S6NOz3hD data-wc=53><strong>And now, do you ever catchyourself looking over your shoulder, wondering if something is after you?</strong>"No. I’m not very scared ofmany things. I definitely think that I would be prepared if there was some sortof apocalypse. I’ve learned so many tricks and things from the prop master. I learn all these survival tools."</p><p id=eG2ccZ-bWpoi data-wc=96><strong>Okay, so if there was anapocalypse, what would be the first thing you’d do, and what would be your bestskill in that type of situation?</strong>"I would take my family,well I mean my whole entire family, including everyone that lives in L.A. andNew York, we would all meet. We have a meeting point. I would do whatever ittook to get there either in a car or on a motorcycle, on a bicycle, I’d walk,just so we’d all be together. I’ve got good aim so probably, I would be theassassin of the group. I’ve got a good shot."</p><p style=text-align:center id=ev1gD2ITIVEu data-wc=2>Photo: Instagram.com/@lucytwobows</p><p id=e_G49c5G2e7J data-wc=69><strong>For this season, were youpregnant with Marley while filming?</strong>"Yeah. I was very, verymuch pregnant. Kind of from the get-go, and you know I was lucky enough to havepeople be so excited and willing to make it work. I also pushed myself a lot towork really hard and even when scenes were super grueling or we had 18-hourdays, I never complained or anything. I was just grateful to be there."</p><p id=enKdTMlzFRv6 data-wc=79><strong>You film in Georgia. Does itmake you miss L.A. or are you loving raising Marley there? </strong>"Yeah, I like beingseparated from it all. I think that’s maybe also why we’re all so close becausewe don’t get to just get off work and go home and hang out with our friends andfamily. It’s like these are our friends and family and these are the bonds wecreated out here so, I really, really enjoy shooting on location. Atlanta is agreat city."</p><p id=eaZdLIjsIwDG data-wc=67><strong>Have you and Brick bothendured many sleepless nights since becoming parents? </strong>"We’re a good tag team.He’s the best dad in the world. I’ll do nights, he’ll do days. We sleep when wesleep. I’m used to an actor’s schedule which you don’t really get much sleepanyways, and he’s a photographer and travels with Tyler, the Creator, so hedoesn’t really sleep either. We kind of just figure it out."</p><p id=eAb8dO_3e5hV data-wc=20><strong>How old is your daughtergoing to have to be before you let her watch ? </strong>[Pauses to think] "20.Yeah."</p><p id=ehKNPwTCTPzD data-wc=11>CatchAlanna on , Sundays at 9 p.m. ETon AMC.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
