"It's extremely unfair to be black listed because a ridiculous naive stigmatism created by unethical homophobes," Eli Hunter tweeted.</p><p>"I have been doing films for over 8 years and have never contracted anything because my health and safety comes first. So yes, offence taken."</p><p>Nick Capra said she "may be the stupidest woman I've come across in 15 years of this industry". "Next time use your brain when openly being a c*** on Twitter," he said.</p><p>Sinn Sage described safety concerns as "bulls***". "Before your shoot [with] said performer, for a [big] shoot, he would have to get tested, by the same testing companies we all use," she tweeted.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-world">Related articles</h2><p>"When the results are clear, you are clear to f*** him.

"Either or we'll take it," he tweeted.</p><p>In response, Ms Ames tweeted that she was "not homophobic". "Most girls don't shoot with guys who have shot gay porn, for safety," she wrote. "That's just how it is with me. I'm not putting my body at risk, I don't know what they do in their private lives."</p><p>She later added she didn't "have anything to apologise for". "Apologising for taking extra steps to ensure that my body stays safe?" she tweeted.</p><p>"F*** you guys attacking me when none of my intentions were malicious. I f***ing love the gay community! What the f*** ever! I CHOOSE who I have inside my body.

Someone who I liked & would have even called a friend!"</p><p>Australian porn star Madison Missina weighed in on Thursday, saying "sadly the bullying within the industry has taken another life".</p><p>"August Ames was bullied horrendously for the past 24 hrs for standing up for her rights to choose who she works with," she tweeted.
