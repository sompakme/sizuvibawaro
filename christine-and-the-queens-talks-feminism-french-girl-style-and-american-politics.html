Yet even though the Nantes-born singer is dressed like a classic French girl (turtleneck, blazer, fitted trousers), she feels right at home. "Last time I was here, I stayed on the Lower East Side," she said, without sounding remotely like a downtown know-it-all, then added, "I had this moment where I thought, Oh, I could live here and be totally happy." Fresh off a headlining show at Terminal 5 in New York City—a "savory gig"—Letissier got candid about the F word, why French-girl style is a total sham, and when we can expect some new music.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>last time we spoke</a>, you told me about the origin of your moniker. How different is your stage persona from your real-life personality?</b><br>Recently, I realized that Christine is just me. I had to go mentally to that point where I decided to have a character, but it was really about being totally myself. I have more filters on when I'm in my civil state; I feel more sheltered and a bit self-conscious. I'm more myself when I'm Christine. I feel absolutely free.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>How so?</b><br>I embrace everything more—especially my sexuality. It all feels more natural and fluid. I used to be really socially awkward. When I talked for a long time with other people, I got tired and had to shelter myself away. I feel like I'm standing on my feet now.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Where did your fascination with suits come from?</b><br>It was me obsessing with this idea of being a woman owning men's clothes, the idea of adapting menswear into a female's body and creating a new version of femininity. I always thought a woman could look really empowered in men's clothing, and I loved the idea of stealing things from men. It was part of the character to want to be treated like a man, because men are sometimes more free.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dustin Condren</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>I find it interesting that you wrote "iT" about becoming a man, but you seem to be a feminist at heart.</b><br>The word "feminist" seems gross to people, and I don't know why. It's related to a bad image of feminism that implies you're angry at men all the time. For me, feminism means basic notions of equality between men and women. I'm proud to be a feminist because I think there are a lot of things to do as women to be as carefree as men. That song was about me being so angry being a girl that I wanted to escape gender in order to reconcile things. Now, I don't want to be a man—I just want to be considered as much as my male peers are.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Who are some women you admire?</b><br>FKA Twigs is really great. I love her because she's hypersexualized, but on her own terms. She's in charge. I'm a huge fan of Laurie Anderson because she's a very different version of what a woman can be. She has this very witty energy. I can be really empowered by Beyoncé or Rihanna as well. I love how women are taking back control.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Women's rights are a big topic in the U.S. presidential election. Have you been following the coverage at all?</b><br>I watched the debates the other night. They were … scary. But I admire Hillary [Clinton]'s bravery and resilience. I can only imagine how tough it is to be a woman in politics, because it's tough in the music industry. It would be great to have a woman president, because then other women can follow her lead.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dustin Condren</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Everyone wants to dress like a French girl, but is there anything you think Americans do particularly well style-wise?</b><br>Americans have many different styles: punk, normcore. You get to experiment a bit more. Parisian style has a reputation, but it can be a bit suffocating as well. It's the same vibe. We don't really know how to be a <i>Parisienne</i>. When we're abroad, suddenly we become them, but we don't really know what we're doing. It's a projection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>What's the status of your second album?</b><br>I have about 40 songs. I'm very into the process of writing. It's coming together in mental mood boards. The songs are tougher, funkier, sweatier, and sexier. I think I want to create a new way to be sexy. I want to be a horny woman. The new Christine will be this weird, desiring thing. I hope to evolve with her and grow old.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Buy Christine and the Queens for $8 on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>iTunes Store</a> and watch the video for "Saint Claude" above.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeTnb%2Bqv9OipZ5lkaOxbsDHnmSqrZWau7R5yKernqqmnrK4</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./do-you-tip-at-all-inclusive-resorts-in-punta-cana.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Do you tip at all-inclusive resorts in Punta Cana?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./can-i-still-use-my-old-runescape-account.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Can I still use my old RuneScape account?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
