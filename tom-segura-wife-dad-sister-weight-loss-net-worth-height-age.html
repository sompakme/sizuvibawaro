sometimes for his controversies.&nbsp;He is also an actor and writer is mostly popular for&nbsp;</span><span>Completely Normal</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Mostly Stories on NetFlix.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Tom Segura Bio and Age</span></strong></h2><p><span>Born on April 16, 1979 in Cincinnati, Ohio, TomSegura was raised alongside his sister.&nbsp;He is Peruvian, French and Spanish at the same time.&nbsp;It seems his dad gave him some of his fun sides, which he says is a regular contributor to his show.&nbsp;Growing up, Tom lived in places such as Minneapolis, Milwaukee, as well as Vero Beach, Florida.&nbsp;For his education, the&nbsp;</span><span>Shameful</span><span>&nbsp;comedian went to Lenoir-Rhyne University.&nbsp;After finishing his studies, he decided to become a comedian.&nbsp;He went on to reveal that his journey into the world of comedy was all about containing all his frustrations.</span></p><p><span>Tom had quite an interesting life which was not without its many problems.&nbsp;He almost lost his life at the age of 18 when he took a drug overdose which then put him in a coma.&nbsp;It was his sister who called an ambulance to try to save his life.&nbsp;The only thing that helped him survive was the fact that he was fat.</span></p><p><span>Today, Tom Segura directs his own specials on Netflix, including&nbsp;</span><span>Tom Segura: Shameful</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Tom Segura: Mostly Stories</span><span>.&nbsp;More so, he is also very popular when it comes to podcasts like “The Joe Rogan Experience” and “WTF with Marc Maron”.&nbsp;He also has his “Your Mom’s House” podcast which he runs with his wife, Christina Pazsitzky.&nbsp;The podcast has a lot of very dedicated followers and it was inspired by Rogan who also has a very successful podcast.&nbsp;Rogan asked Segura and his wife to start the BD podcast after realizing they were both in the same situation.</span></p><p><span>Segura hasn’t been without his controversies as people wrote to Netflix to censor the comedian’s show Disgraceful on its platform.&nbsp;Different individuals and activists, including the Canadian Down Syndrome Society, have accused him of hate speech after he used the word “retarded” in a joke.&nbsp;Speaking to Change.org, they asked that the jokes are ‘offensive and disrespectful’ and should therefore be taken down.&nbsp;This is the biggest controversy he has entered into.</span></p><h2><strong><span>women</span></strong></h2><p><span>Segura is married to Christina Pazsitzky who loves him, is a comedian, podcaster, writer, host and television personality.&nbsp;Segura and Canadian-American Christina Pazsitzky married in 2008. It was not long after their wedding in 2011 that they started their podcast together.&nbsp;It is the very beautiful woman who ensured the production of the bi-weekly podcast.</span></p><p><span>Apart from being a comedian like her husband, Christina is also an animation writer and she has done voice acting for some.&nbsp;It was from there that she decided to focus mainly on the comedy scene.&nbsp;Ten years later, the royal comedians are married, have a child and are expecting the second child who Christina calls ‘thug 2’.&nbsp;Their first child was born in 2016 and she is expected to give birth to the second towards the end of 2018.</span></p><p><span>Christina Pazsitzky and Segura now reside in Los Angeles, where they also work.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>The comedian has a net worth of $3 million.&nbsp;His wife, on the other hand, has an estimated net worth of $2 million.&nbsp;With more projects on the way at the moment, it’s expected that the super comedy duo will see their value rise even faster.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height and body weight (weight loss)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Now a dad, the comedian joked that he needs to try his hand and lose weight because he doesn’t want his kids to be called to school because their dad is fat.&nbsp;The irony is that, as has been pointed out, his weight was one of the things that saved his life when he was a teenager, when he overdosed.</span></p><p><span>Looking at the man’s body measurement, he is slightly above average in weight and height.&nbsp;While his height is 6ft 1in (1.85m), his weight is unknown, although he revealed that he and another comic star who is also overweight made fans bulk up to shaming them in a weight loss contest.&nbsp;Thanks to this, he lost up to 50 pounds.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGisn6J6tLHGrqmaZaees6Z5w5qbZquZqMGmvoywnKKfmKl6rbvSrGSnnaRixLC%2B06FkoZ2ZnLW1ecCgnGavmaC2cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-emily-tisch-sussman-wears-to-work.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Emily Tisch Sussman Wears to Work</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./this-was-michael-jordan-s-worst-basketball-game-ever.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>This Was Michael Jordan's Worst Basketball Game Ever</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
