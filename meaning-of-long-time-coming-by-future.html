Through his lyrics, Future takes us on a journey through his thoughts and emotions, reminiscing about a past love and contemplating the ways in which both he and his partner have changed.One standout lyric in the song is, "I put in overtime inside this vocal booth, It's amazing how crazy in love you wit' the kid." These lines convey Future's dedication to his music and his realization of how his success has impacted his relationships. This theme can be explored further by delving into the idea that achieving professional goals sometimes requires sacrifice in personal relationships. Future's growth as an artist is juxtaposed with the changes in his romantic life, leading to a bittersweet reflection on the choices he has made.Another significant lyric in the song is, "We both moved on, I bet you still reminiscing, I hurt you so bad, I just need for you to listen." This line suggests a lingering sentiment of guilt and regret for the pain Future may have caused his former partner. Through this lyrical theme, one can delve into the concept of self-forgiveness and the need for closure. Future recognizes the impact he had on his past love, and by seeking her attention, he is looking for a cathartic opportunity to apologize and find peace within himself.In the verse, "Over the weekend went to Vegas, crossed my memory, I was taking out the limo thinking, How much you were there for me," Future reflects on the support and love he received from his former partner. This lyric captures the idea of reminiscing on the positive aspects of a past relationship, rather than solely focusing on the pain or mistakes. It allows for a discussion about gratitude and the importance of acknowledging the positive moments shared with someone, even after things have ended.The phone call at the end of the song further emphasizes the theme of reflection and growth. It represents Future reaching out, showing concern for his former partner's well-being, and acknowledging his past behavior. This phone call can be seen as a symbol of maturity and a desire to heal past wounds. It demonstrates the potential for personal growth, as Future expresses his willingness to be there for his ex-girlfriend, despite the fact that they have both moved on.The overall theme of "Long Time Coming" centers around introspection, growth, and the acknowledgment of past actions. Future's lyrics paint a picture of a person who has come a long way, both professionally and personally, and is now looking back at his past with a newfound understanding. Each standout line in the song adds depth to this theme, exploring different aspects of the human experience, including sacrifice, self-forgiveness, gratitude, and personal growth. Through this creative and imaginative lens, Future's song becomes a powerful reflection on the complexities of relationships and the journey towards self-discovery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonynwdOuqZ5nnZqur7XNoGSonl2hvK%2BzjK2gpp1dmLyutc2gZJuxXZvCtcHRng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./moses-bliss-wife-calls-on-god-to-connect-singles-to-their-right-partners-do-it-for-ur-childre.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Moses Bliss Wife Calls on God to Connect Singles to Their Right Partners: Do It for Ur Childre</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joi-marshall-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joi Marshall Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
