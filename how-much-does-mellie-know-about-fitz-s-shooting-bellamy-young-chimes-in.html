Grant’s wife, Julia, had a last-minute change of heart about attending the theater. “There’s precedent for wives being tuned in to a higher frequency when their beloveds are imperiled.”</p><p>Considering Mellie has already challenged Cyrus and Olivia for a seat at the table — and begrudgingly received one as part of Hollis’ “secret circle” of folks connected to the voting machine rigging, Young says the first lady has a “true and abiding” love for Fitz (<strong>Tony Goldwyn</strong>) — that doesn’t come with putting him in harm’s way.</p><p>“She loves Fitz but I have to believe that it’s difficult for her to ever see any good out of harming Fitz,” she says.</p><p>Part of that love, of course, comes in the form of believing so much in Fitz that she, Olivia (<strong>Kerry Washington</strong>) and Cyrus — among others — all tag-teamed to rig the election in Defiance, Ohio, in the Republican’s favor, thus propelling him to the White House.</p><p>“They’re all doing it out of equal parts love and ambition,” she says. “They all believe in Fitz; he’s a once in a generation man and they also believe he’s not capable of doing what it actually takes to rule as it were.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: ‘Scandal’: Why is Olivia Planning Fitz’s Funeral?</a></strong></p><p>While Young notes Mellie is on equal footing with everyone at that table, she says the prim and proper mother-to-be has super powers of her own, comparing the character to Batman‘s Penguin and even 101 Dalmatians’ Cruella deVil.</p><p>“She’d like to think she’s Wonder Woman but I think there’s a little bit of evil in her,” Young says with a laugh.</p><p>So with the president in intensive care following the shooting, how will the first lady respond to Olivia wanting to be near the man she loves — and helped elect? Young says Mellie might take one for the team.</p><p>“When you’re at that deathbed all that matters is what’s best for them and I know Fitz loves her — and I love her enough to want her there if it helps him,” she says, noting Mellie and Sally will eventually lock horns. “I’d move the world if it helps him.”</p><p>Do you think Mellie played a role in Fitz’s shooting?

Scandal‘s midseason finale airs Thursday at 10 p.m. on ABC.</p><p>Email:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Lesley.Goldberg@thr.com</a>; Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>@Snoodit</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrJqappSWuW6%2Fz6igpZ2iqHqntdOzZKadnKG2pnmTaWhqbWJk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-the-cambridges-and-sussexes-have-upped-their-social-media-game.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How the Cambridges and Sussexes have upped their social media game</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./houston-jones-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Houston Jones Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
