The Emmy-winning satire — which doubled as a dark murder mystery while also exploring a new set of miserable upper-class vacationers — <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>answered the big question about who died</a> in its finale, but left lingering questions surrounding the main foursome of Plaza’s Harper and her husband Ethan (Will Sharpe), and the couple they were vacationing with Daphne (Meghann Fahy) and her husband Cameron (Theo James).</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">After a tense week that exposed cracks in both marriages, Ethan confronted Harper about what really happened between Harper and Cameron when the pair disappeared into their hotel room earlier in the trip. After at first denying anything sexual, Harper supposedly came clean in the finale, insisting to her husband that she and his friend only kissed. Ethan couldn’t shake his gut feeling that she wasn’t telling him the full truth, and when he filled in Daphne, Daphne responded by seductively leading Ethan to a nearby cove and leaving what really happened between them up to viewers’ imaginations.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Creator Mike White himself <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>didn’t fully fill in the blanks</a> about what viewers didn’t see in both scenarios, but implied that enough went down between each partner’s swapping to bring “back that first sexual charge that happens in the beginning of relationships and sometimes fades away over time” for Harper and Ethan, who are then reunited in the bedroom and are last seen looking mildly happier than when they arrived (or at least more physically connected) while waiting for their plane home at the airport (pictured above).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On Monday’s Late Night With Seth Meyers, Plaza shared her point of view on Harper and Cameron.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I know what happened, okay? And what happened is, we [Harper and Cameron] did some stuff. And I hated every minute of it. It was disgusting,” she said of Harper’s twisted attracted to Cameron.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Then adding, “And, there was no penetration.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Plaza’s admission sticks loosely to the story that Harper told Ethan, though it implies that her character left some gray details out: Harper and Cameron likely did more than just kiss, just as Ethan had guessed.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When Meyers said he believed Harper that it was just a kiss, and suggested that maybe they each “grabbed each other’s butt,” Plaza questioned the late-night host’s naïveté. “I think I grabbed a little more than that. But, what does my husband do? That’s the real question,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/theo-james-will-sharpe-H-2022.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Meyers also wondered if Harper and Ethan will make it in the long run, and Plaza sounded doubtful. Of the final airport shot, she said, “I was really gunning for doing some takes where maybe we weren’t so happy. Maybe they’ll be okay. But I have a kind of fantasy that Harper divorces him and takes all of his money.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Plaza did clarify that she has not seen the finale yet, because she is saving the entire season to watch in one sitting like a seven-hour movie (she has seen the first two episodes, however).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She also cleared up a story that co-star Fahy had told during a visit to Meyers earlier in the season, about how the pair got lost on a hike during filming.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Meghann Fahy is an incredible actress. And I just want to give it up to her, her performance on the show is sick. She slays. Even though, character-wise I’m like, are you trying to fuck my husband?” said Plaza of Fahy, who has been widely praised for her performance as Daphne.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The detail Fahy left out, says Plaza, is that the pair had taken mushrooms on that hike: “I was tripping, it was terrifying. We were lost on a highway and there were Italian men going ‘vroom, vroom’ like, coming at me. I thought they were taking me to the dark side … I was tripping balls.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrZ%2BeZaedtrWxjKWmra2jYq62rtGesGaonJbHonnHmqmpnaJisKK5xKump2Wjmq60u81maWaemaOurbGMamlsbWJtfnGBkWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./great-things-by-phil-wickham.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Great Things by Phil Wickham</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anya-taylor-joy-wears-spiky-sheer-vintage-gown-to-furiosa-premiere.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anya Taylor-Joy Wears Spiky Sheer Vintage Gown to 'Furiosa' Premiere</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
