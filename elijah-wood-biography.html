"It means nine in Elvish," he says. "It stands for the nine members of the fellowship. A week before the film was finished we decided to go to a tattoo parlour and set the experience permanently on our skin. All the members got this tattoo, even Ian McKellen."</p><p id=ecnngkSEFBlG data-wc=80>With all three episodes of the trilogy gaining good reviews, a tattoo is the least of the changes in Elijah's life he was a youthful 18 when he won the role and is now an international star. The actor says he's committed to keeping his feet on the ground, however. "If you're carefree and relaxed about your life, that will kill a lot of attention," he explains. Elijah Jordan Wood was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on January 28, 1981.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUWTX98tKxvw data-wc=73>By the time he had reached the age of seven, his mother was entering him in modelling competitions to find an outlet for his intense energy. At one event in LA, they met a stranger who suggested Elijah give acting a go. A week later the entire Wood family upped sticks and relocated to Hollywood where, within the year, Elijah made his acting debut: in a video for Paula Abdul's .</p><p id=eZvwwTMeK79- data-wc=75>Elijah was soon picking up bit parts in movies such as the 1989 blockbuster and the 1990 thriller Before long, he graduated to meatier roles alongside big-name stars, such as in 1992's where he played opposite <a aria-label='\"\\"\\\\"Biography\\"\"' class=hm-link href=#>Mel Gibson</a>. Aged 11, he co-starred with Macaulay Culkin in 1993's , and critics hailed Elijah's impressively nuanced performance as marking the emergence of a new child star.&nbsp;</p><p id=etTQQ9oLmpc data-wc=61>By the late-Nineties, Elijah was edging away from the romantic comedies inundating cinemas in search of more demanding roles. The breakthrough came in 1997 with his portrayal of a troubled teen coming of age in the early-Seventies in , alongside Sigourney Weaver and Kevin Kline. A year later, he landed a starring role in the surprise blockbuster .&nbsp;</p><p id=eSJiGLTZhvuP data-wc=96>In retrospect, Elijah seemed destined to play a hobbit. His diminutive size helps, of course; he's barely 5ft 5in tall. But as early as 1994, Elijah was declaring that the was his favourite book, and when he discovered was in production, the native Iowan called in a dialogue coach to hone his English accent, and auditioned. In July 1999, director Peter Jackson offered him the part. "I was overwhelmed, just ecstatic," Elijah admits. "I couldn't really speak. My sister was running through the house screaming. It was a great day."&nbsp;</p><p id=eoa0GK2P_zsE data-wc=65>With an impressive portfolio of films under his belt, the youthful actor remains unfazed by his rise to fame. "I won't change and my perspective won't change," he says. "I want to continue my life the way I live it, and I'm not going to let anything stop me from doing that. It isn't all about acting. There's a lot more to life than Hollywood."</p><p id=eynfg-duoAsk data-wc=32>Elijah has since had roles in several films and TV shows, and also found love with Danish film producer Mette-Marie Kongsved, with whom he has two children, a son and a daughter.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_lag0e70>More Profiles:</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9qamRksq21yZqfZq%2BfpLFw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./greta-gerwig-on-jo-koy-s-golden-globes-barbie-joke-he-s-not-wrong.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Greta Gerwig on Jo Koy's Golden Globes 'Barbie' Joke: &amp;quot;Hes Not Wrong&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./edward-gallardo-dead-playwright-dies-at-70.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Edward Gallardo Dead: Playwright Dies at 70</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
