Hurd’s journey through college football and his brief professional career have been marked by both promise and setbacks. In this article, we will delve into Jalen Hurd’s net worth as of 2024, examining the various factors that have influenced his financial standing.</p><table><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Detail</th></tr><tr><td>Estimated Net Worth:</td><td>$1 million</td></tr><tr><td>Age:</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Born:</td><td>January 23, 1996</td></tr><tr><td>Country of Origin:</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Source of Wealth:</td><td>Professional Football, Endorsements</td></tr></table><h2 id=early-life-and-college-career-nyUBpfTUrF>Early Life and College Career</h2><p>Jalen Hurd was born on January 23, 1996, in Hendersonville, Tennessee. He showed early promise as a football player, which eventually led him to play for the University of Tennessee. His college career was notable, as he showcased his skills as a running back.
