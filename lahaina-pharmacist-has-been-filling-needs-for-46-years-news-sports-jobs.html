The Maui News / MATTHEW THAYER photos</p><p>During his 46-year career in pharmacy, the last 21 spent helping the people of Lahaina, Dr. Bill Robusto has worked to make sure the next generation is ready to carry the torch.</p><p>He says he is proud to see students he has mentored go on to careers in pharmacy. Seven Lahainaluna High School students he has advised are either licensed pharmacists or about to graduate into the field. When Robusto retires as pharmacy manager from Lahaina Walgreens today, he is scheduled to be replaced by a Lahainaluna graduate, Jerilyn Gudoy.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I’ve tried my best to encourage the local kids,”</span> he said.</p><p>Two more beneficiaries of Robusto’s mentorship were working with him behind the Walgreens counter Thursday afternoon. University of South Carolina pharmacy students Emily Stauffer and Tristan Gore are on a monthlong rotation at the pharmacy before graduating as pharmacists next month.</p><p>Robusto also takes pride in the relationships he has formed within the Lahaina community. He says he reminds students that the profession is much more than counting pills into bottles.</p><img width=600 height=687 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2022/05/02061708/mt-dr-bill-robusto-b-4-28-22.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Dr. Bill Robusto Robusto retires as pharmacy manager from Lahaina Walgreens today. He is scheduled to be replaced by a Lahainaluna graduate, Jerilyn Gudoy.</p><p><span class=quotations>“In community pharmacy, you become like an integral member of the community because you are meeting people who have a need,”</span> Robusto said. <span class=quotations>“It’s kind of like the corner drug store, Norman Rockwell pharmacy. Some of these people you see once a week or once a month for years, so you become a member of their family. You see babies born and go off to college.”</span></p><p>He has been saying his goodbyes to those longtime customers and, with some, it hasn’t been easy.</p><p><span class=quotations>“You can get your medication anywhere, including online,”</span> he said. <span class=quotations>“The reason they come to some pharmacies is because they have a relationship with the pharmacist and the staff. Saying goodbye to the loyal local folks, it has been going on for weeks. For some of them, it shakes them up.”</span></p><p>Robusto graduated from the University of Southern California’s School of Pharmacy as a Doctor of Pharmacy in 1976. He and wife Lorri arrived to Maui in 2001 when he went to work at Longs Drugs at the Lahaina Cannery Mall. In 2008, he moved across Honoapiilani Highway to help open the Lahaina Walgreens as pharmacy manager.</p><p><span class=quotations>“We’ve had an amazing group of employees down here,”</span> he said. <span class=quotations>“Two of the technicians have been with me since we opened the store, and the other pharmacist as well. To have that low turnover is remarkable. They have become instrumental in the success of the pharmacy.”</span></p><p>He says changes he has witnessed over the span of his long career include the addition of new duties and services pharmacists provide, such as administering immunizations. He says the makeup of the staff has also evolved.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It used to be primarily a male-dominated profession and in my lifetime it has shifted,”</span> Robusto said. <span class=quotations>“I think the matriculation rate is now 85 percent female. For instance, I am the only male working at the pharmacy. It says something about their level of discipline and commitment.”</span></p><p>He says considering how big a role a pharmacy plays in a community, it is surprising how little people know about the business. Hollywood makes movies and TV shows about doctors, lawyers and countless other professions, he scoffs, but not pharmacists. And that’s one reason why Robusto wrote a novel on the subject. Released in 2003, <span class=quotations>“The Candy Store Conspiracy”</span> uncovers a <span class=quotations>“diabolical terrorism threat”</span> within the pharmaceutical ranks.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Very few people know what happens behind the scenes at a pharmacy,”</span> Robusto said. <span class=quotations>“It was my way to try to get something out there to tell the story. It’s a fictitious story, but it’s based on fact.”</span></p><p>When asked if he planned to write any books in retirement, Robusto admitted he does have a few ideas floating around, but first he and Lorri are going to enjoy traveling and relaxing together. He said they are scheduled to go on an African safari next month and hope to visit Europe next year. He also plans to get out into the ocean and surf more.</p><p>Walgreens certified pharmacy tech Mary Caraang says she is going to miss Robusto’s fatherly presence.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Uncle Bill is like a dad for everybody,”</span> she said. <span class=quotations>“He’s the best.”</span></p><p>* Matthew Thayer can be reached at thayer@maui.net.</p><a href=#><img width=262 height=300 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2022/05/02061708/mt-dr-bill-robusto-b-4-28-22-262x300.jpg alt decoding=async aria-describedby=gallery-4-983221 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Dr. Bill Robusto Robusto retires as pharmacy manager from Lahaina Walgreens today.
