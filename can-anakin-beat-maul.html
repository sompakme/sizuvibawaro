Maul wouldn't stand a chance. <b>Anakin stomps.</b></span></span><h2>Is Anakin stronger than Darth Maul?</h2>Maul (hypothetical) In the Clone Wars season 7 episode The Phantom Apprentice, Ahsoka says to Maul that he would not last long against Anakin in a fight. Its safe to say Anakin was more powerful than Maul, but I was wondering how a fight between them would play out.<h2>Who defeats Darth Maul?</h2>Calming himself, Obi-Wan leaped over Maul and used Qui-Gon's lightsaber to sever Maul in two. On Dathomir, the Nightsister leader Mother Talzin believed that Darth Maul was alive and in exile somewhere in the Outer Rim.<h2>Who would win Vader or Maul?</h2>Considering his infamy, it's hard to deny that Darth Vader is the more powerful of the two, but his victory over Maul wouldn't come easily. As the Emperor's enforcer, Vader is terrifying.<h2>Can ahsoka beat Maul?</h2>Ahsoka beating Maul makes her scaling near-equally to Dooku and ROTS Anakin, as of TCW S7. There can be a case made for Maul holding back (as one Redditor did) and it is a possibility. It was confirmed Maul was overconfident, but IIRC, he dealt with stronger Jedi while still overconfident.<h2>What if Anakin Went to Mandalore to Fight Maul- Star Wars Theory (Scenario 1)</h2><p></p><h2>Can Luke beat Darth Maul?</h2>As much as fans would probably want to see Luke win this matchup, it is pretty unlikely. Luke is strong with the force, something Maul struggles with. He is so focused on his hatred that his Force sensitivity evades him. But when it comes to lightsaber combat, Maul is the definite winner.<h2>Is Maul more powerful than Obi-Wan?</h2>For some reason there is a general consensus that Obi wan is stronger than Maul (correct me if im wrong, but it does seem like it). But I believe I have a strong case that Maul is indeed, stronger and more cunning than Obi Wan. First, TPM fight. Maul pretty easily had beaten Obi wan and Qui Gon IN A 1v2.<h2>Was Maul afraid of Sidious?</h2>However, despite his new-found hatred for his former master, Maul still greatly feared Palpatine, referring to him as "the most powerful being in the galaxy". Upon sensing his presence on Mandalore, Maul's initial reaction to Sidious was fear, then feigned respect and devotion to try and win back his favor.<h2>Who would win Luke Anakin?</h2>If they were both Jedi Knights (meaning they were the same age,23,Anakin: ROTS and Luke: ROTJ) Anakin would definitely win. He had already fought whole armies of battle droids, Count Dooku and Obi-Wan while Luke was able to defeat Vader in return of the Jedi but let's be honest, Vader was most likely holding back.<h2>Who is the most powerful Sith?</h2>Truly, the most powerful Sith Lord was Darth Sidious, better known in his public persona of Chancellor (later Emperor) Palpatine. Through cunning and manipulation, Sidious killed his master to claim the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith.<h2>Who would win Vader or Yoda?</h2>There are certainly scenarios where Darth Vader would have the upper hand in a duel with Yoda, but in most cases, Yoda would be the more likely victor. Vader wields absurd levels of Force power during his dark side prime that would certainly rival Yoda's own abilities, but likely not exceed them.<h2>Was Anakin the chosen one?</h2>Anakin ultimately fulfilled his role as the Chosen One and brought balance to the Force, fulfilling Qui-Gon Jinn's belief in the prophecy that foretold Anakin's destiny. Accepting his fate, Anakin joined his Jedi mentors in death by becoming one with the Force.<h2>Can Anakin beat Vader?</h2>Darth Vader edged out Anakin in the lightsaber combat category, and it was not as close as people would think it should be. Vader won over Anakin due to sheer experience and adaptability, and while Anakin was an impressive warrior, Vader was in a league of his own.<h2>Did maul and Grievous meet?</h2>Maul and Grievous met in single combat, while the two armies collided and suffered heavy losses. By the battle's end, Maul ordered his forces to retreat, while the Sith waited for him to find Mother Talzin.<h2>What if Anakin and Obi-Wan went to Mandalore?</h2>With Obi-Wan on Mandalore, another Jedi would've gone to Utapau instead and they might've failed to kill Grievous, but that would only delay the ending of the Clone Wars for so long. Palpatine would still need Order 66 and the creation of the Empire to control the galaxy.<h2>Can Darth Maul use force lightning?</h2>Despite being a powerful user of the dark side of the Force, Darth Maul never used Force lightning in any of the Star Wars films or shows. Despite so many dark side characters using Force lightning in Star Wars, Maul never used it any of his appearances on the small or big screens.<h2>Who can beat Darth Vader?</h2>1. Obi-Wan Kenobi. Of all today's characters, Anakin's own Jedi Master most notably conquered the newly-fallen Sith Lord at the height of his power, before his need for movement-restricting armor.<h2>Did Rex know Anakin was Vader?</h2>The Moment Captain Rex Discovered Darth Vader was Anakin Skywalker.<h2>Did Darth Maul know about Order 66?</h2>Was he aware of what it would lead to, and what that specifically meant for the clones themselves in Star Wars? We know from Star Wars:The Clone Wars Season 4 dialogue and Dave Filoni's word that Darth Maul was fully aware of Sidious's machinations to overthrow the Jedi Order.<h2>Why did Palpatine keep Maul alive?</h2>In fact, in this same scene, Sidious says he is keeping Maul alive because he has "other uses for you!" If Palpatine thought Maul knew he about his double identity, there's no way he would have let him stay alive.<h2>Did Palpatine know about the clone army?</h2>Little did Sifo-Dyas know that Sidious and Dooku had learned of his ordering the clone army and planned the steps to his demise. The first test provided to Dooku was to murder his old friend.<h2>Can Mace Windu beat Darth Maul?</h2>Mace windu clear winner 9/10 times. His use of vapad would make the fight play out similair to windu vs palpatine. He would use the seething rage pouring out of maul against him, and as mauls force power was so much weaker than windu's it would be an undisputed win for windu.<h2>Is Darth Vader stronger than Count Dooku?</h2>It's not even up for debate that Darth Vader is stronger than Count Dooku. Even before he was at full power, Anakin Skywalker was able to overpower Dooku simply based on his lightsaber training.<h2>How many Midichlorians does Sidious?</h2>Obi-Wan Kenobi's Midi-chlorian count is around 13,000, Yoda's clocks in at 17,700, and Darth Sidious is estimated to be about 20,000. Anakin Skywalker is said to have had the largest Midi-chlorian count in Jedi history, which is around 28,000 to 30,000, with George Lucas insinuating it could be as high as 40,000.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWaZnpa4qrqMm5yarF2irra4</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chats-leak-as-man-s-talking-stage-with-lady-ends-abruptly-over-unexpected-statement-people-react.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chats Leak as Man's Talking Stage with Lady Ends Abruptly Over Unexpected Statement, People React</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jacob-whitesides-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-rumours-an.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jacob Whitesides Dating Now?
