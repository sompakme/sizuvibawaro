He would always look after her, he would always protect her if he had to. Hell would fall on anyone who attacked Molly.

Sherlock Holmes kisses Molly Hooper (Louise Brealey), who helps him fake his fall.<h2>Why did Sherlock kiss Moriarty?</h2>Cumberbatch's answer was simple: "We didn't actually kiss," he told a reporter during a panel at the TCA press tour on Monday. Man of few words, eh?
