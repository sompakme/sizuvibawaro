It’s when Gabrielle ‘Coco’ Chanel introduced a very special bag, one that would become an enduring icon of the brand and something of a household name. 68 years later, the 2.55 – named after its birth month and year – continues to capture hearts and court demand, despite its exponentially rising price. For this reason, it’s also one of those elusive fashion purchases that really is an ‘investment piece’, but more on that later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today, the 2.55 hardly seems radical, but in 1929 – when its first iteration was released – it was unlike anything that had been seen before. Traditionally, women’s bags were designed to be carried by a top handle or as a clutch, so Chanel’s addition of a shoulder strap (inspired by those found on soldiers’ bags) was both defiant and practical, leaving the wearer hands-free and able to move without restriction – or simply able to put their hands in their pockets, as the designer liked to do. Chanel believed in the design so passionately that she reintroduced the bag in 1955, 26 years after she’d first dreamt it up and a year after she relaunched her eponymous house.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The bag itself was rectangular in shape and dressed in soft, lambskin leather, a material previously reserved for the making of gloves. It fastened via a discreet, turnlock closure, christened the ‘Mademoiselle’ in honour of Chanel’s unmarried status. In fact, practically every element represented some facet of Gabrielle Chanel’s life. There was the diamond (and later, chevron) quilting, inspired by equestrian riding coats, covers and saddle blankets; the designer had loved horse riding and racing ever since she was introduced to it in the 1910s by Étienne Balsan, a wealthy textile heir and equestrian enthusiast.</p><img alt="chanel bag" title="Fashion Photo Session In Paris - June 2022" width=8640 height=5760 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alice-mouzon-wears-a-beige-long-mid-season-trench-coat-from-news-photo-1689339527.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Edward Berthelot</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Watch how the iconic Chanel quilted handbag is made" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/38a08d0f-da9a-45ba-abf3-e6e680170452/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1617100613_88007.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some also conjecture the diamond-shaped stitching was Chanel’s nod to the stained-glass windows of the convent of Aubazine’s orphanage (where she spent her early years), that the bag’s burgundy lining was the same colour as the convent uniforms, and the chain-link strap resembled the key chains of Aubazine’s caretakers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Most notably, the 2.55 had a secret pocket hidden inside the front flap, reportedly designed for the discreet storage of love letters. Certainly, Chanel was never short of lovers (and, one assumes, love letters), and is reported to have enjoyed romances with the composer Igor Stravinsky, artist Salvador Dalí, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia (with whom she created Chanel No. 5), and Arthur ‘Boy’ Capel.</p><img alt="street style berlin may, 2023" title="Street Style - Berlin - May, 2023" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/leo-eberlin-seen-wearing-zara-short-denim-blue-jumpsuits-news-photo-1689339591.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeremy Moeller</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">68 years later, the 2.55 remains largely unchanged, though it has been reimagined in three additional sizes – maxi, large, and mini – and a whole host of colours and finishes, from denim to sequins, in addition to classic lambskin and the more practical ‘aged calfskin.’ Eagle-eyed 2.55 fanciers will notice that many of the bags on resale sites such as Vestiaire Collective and 1stdibs are labelled ‘2.55 Reissue’; this was the name given by Karl Lagerfeld to the 2005 edition of the bag (an exact copy of the original), to celebrate its 50th anniversary.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 2.55 is often confused with the Classic Flap (also more recently known as the 11.12, after the bag’s style code number), introduced in 1983 by Karl Lagerfeld as a tribute to the original. In contrast to the 2.55’s nearly logo-less Mademoiselle turnlock and all-metal chain, the Classic Flap fastens via a CC closure, its chain strap interlaced with leather. It comes in six sizes, offering slightly more variety than the 2.55, and is available in grained ‘Caviar’ leather.</p><img alt="chanel bag" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - September 20, 2022" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/katie-holmes-is-seen-in-tribeca-on-september-20-2022-in-new-news-photo-1689339628.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Gotham</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The term ‘investment buy’ is one that’s bandied around, often inaccurately, but it’s an apt description of the 2.55. Its rate of appreciation has far outpaced inflation, with prices increasing considerably year on year, whether purchased directly from Chanel or on resale. According to Sotheby’s, the 2.55 was first sold for around £170 in 1955; today, it costs more than £8,500, a 200 per cent increase since 2016. It’s the same story for the Classic Flap. Meanwhile, the resale prices generally match or exceed the face values of well-kept styles – vintage or new – and rare bags command even higher prices.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you’re a fan of the 2.55 or the Classic Flap, you’re not alone. Kate Moss, Penelope Cruz, Janelle Monae, Katie Holmes, Apple Martin and Alessandra Ambrosio are just a few of the celebrities who have been pictured with one of these iconic quilted bags in tow, in the daytime and to red-carpet events, proving that the design transcends ages and dress codes.</p><img alt="chanel bag" title="Chanel : Front Row - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Spring Summer 2023" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shalom-brune-franklin-attends-the-chanel-haute-couture-news-photo-1689339727.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Marc Piasecki</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The best time to buy a 2.55 or Classic Flap bag? If time travel is an option, 1990 or earlier – that’s when price hikes began to exceed inflation. The second best time to buy one? Right now. If the last 68 years are anything to go by, it is almost guaranteed to increase in value. And if you do get your hands on the hallowed bag, you can be safe in the knowledge that it has been painstakingly crafted at Ateliers de Verneuil-en-Halatte, one of Chanel's Métiers d’art, by artisans who have undergone at least four years of training, mastering each and every technique to bring the 2.55 and Classic Flap (or 11.12) to life. Love letters are not included with purchase, but a certain je ne sais quoi is.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSudYCUbWlwbWhksKmtzZ6jZmpdaoJursCgZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-there-be-a-season-two-of-tiny-pretty-things-on-netflix.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will there be a season two of Tiny Pretty Things on Netflix?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-preston-werner-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Preston-Werner Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
