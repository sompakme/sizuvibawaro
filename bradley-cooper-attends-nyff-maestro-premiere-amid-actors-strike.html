He had been skipping press opportunities, including the movie’s <a href=#>world premiere at the Venice Film Festival</a>, due to the ongoing actors strike, but he was in the audience at Lincoln Center’s David Geffen Hall on Monday night.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Speaking from the stage as she introduced <a href=# id=auto-tag_maestro_1 data-tag=maestro>Maestro</a>, Leonard Bernstein’s daughter Jamie triumphantly told the packed auditorium that Cooper was able to watch the film in keeping with SAG-AFTRA strike rules.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The Screen Actors Guild guidelines permit our director, Mr. Cooper, to watch his film with us here tonight,” Bernstein said. “So let’s all welcome Bradley Cooper to the debut of his beautiful film.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A rep for SAG confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that Cooper was allowed to attend the screening because he was not promoting the film, pointing to the film festival section of the strike rules, which states in part, “performers are free to attend film festivals or other <a href=# id=auto-tag_events_1 data-tag=events>events</a>.” But they cannot “promote struck work or struck companies at such events,” by, for instance, “serving on a Q&A panel” or walking the <a href=# id=auto-tag_red-carpet_1 data-tag=red-carpet>red carpet</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Netflix later confirmed Cooper was in the audience.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Directors Guild of America quickly reached a new deal with the AMPTP group that represents studios and streamers over the summer while the Writers Guild of America has reached <a href=#>a tentative agreement</a> with the AMPTP. The Writers Guild last week <a href=#>voted to end the strike</a> while the deal was being ratified.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA is still on strike but <a href=#>resumed negotiations with the AMPTP on Monday</a>, with the two sides expected to talk again on Wednesday.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Due to the writers strike ending, Cooper’s co-writer Josh Singer, who skipped the Venice world premiere for Maestro, was able to attend the NY Film Festival event and spoke with media outlets on the red carpet and participated in a post-screening Q&A.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Speaking to THR about the end of the writers strike prior to Monday’s screening, Singer said he was grateful to the WGA negotiators “who I think worked very hard and bravely fought to put in protections for writers for many years to come.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He added, “And I’m also grateful that it’s over, and I get to stand here today and talk about a movie I’ve been working on for nine years.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Singer added that he was hopeful for a speedy resolution to the actors strike.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I know there are different issues [with the actors than with the WGA], but I’m hopeful just so the town can get working again,” he said. “But I think actors need to get the protections they want.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When asked he and his fellow producers felt about debuting Maestro amid the ongoing actors strike, producer Fred Berner indicated he was hopeful a resolution would be coming soon.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’m just sad I can’t hug all of these folks and celebrate,” he said. “We will hopefully have an opportunity. I’m starting to think it’s beginning to thaw a little bit.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He added, “I think it’s worse for [the actors] than it is for us. How can you put all of that time and energy and love into something and not be able to stand there and get a smidgen of it back?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKO%2BwJ2jnrFdmLywvMSrZJqspJq7pb%2BMppieq6SnvG680Z6kop2imnpzfJFsZKexXZu2rbmMn5ysrJmrrq15kGtqbm5gbH12gY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-you-take-a-curling-iron-on-a-plane.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Can you take a curling iron on a plane?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./boonk-gang-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Boonk Gang Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
