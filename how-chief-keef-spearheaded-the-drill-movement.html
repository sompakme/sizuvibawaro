This sound defied the commercialized rap of the mainstream and captured the harsh realities of life in poverty-stricken, violent neighborhoods. A young artist named <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chief Keef</a> ignited this sonic revolution with his gritty rhymes and menacing beats, creating a new hip-hop subgenre: drill music.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-defining-the-drill-sound>Defining The Drill Sound</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Born Keith Farrelle Cozart, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Chief Keef's rise to hip-hop fame</a> is attributed to the development of the drill sound. Chief Keef's songs, from his breakout mixtape Back from the Dead to his debut album Finally Rich, exhibited drill's raw, aggressive lyrics accompanied by ominous beats. Chief Keef's sound included elements that would come to define drill music. His flow was uniqueâ€”a melodic, almost slurred delivery that prioritized vibe and emotion over technical proficiency. With ominous synths, hard-hitting 808s, and an intense cadence that reflected life on the streets, his beats were menacing. Moreover, Chief Keef's music conveyed <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the dynamism of drill</a>, an expression of marginalized communities' struggles and triumphs. Often overlooked or misrepresented in mainstream media, his lyrics paint vivid pictures of the oppression he grew up in.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-shaping-the-sound-of-hip-hop><strong><strong><strong>Shaping The Sound Of Hip-hop</strong></strong></strong></h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The impact of Chief Keef's pioneering work was felt almost immediately. Back from the Dead, his breakthrough mixtape launched him onto the scene in 2012. The project, which included viral hits like "Love Sosa" and "I Don't Like," showcased Chief Keef's unique sound and style. The "I Don't Like" music video offered a voyeuristic glimpse into Chief Keef's world. In a sparsely furnished apartment, the young rapper leads a throng of friends in moments of raw authenticity.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As Chief Keef's fame grows, Kanye West's unauthorized remix of "I Don't Like" is released. The remix features guest verses from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Pusha T</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Big Sean</a>, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jadakiss</a>. Despite not being sanctioned by Chief Keef or his team, this high-profile collaboration cements his position as an emerging artist. It also sets the stage for the ongoing debate over who can truly claim ownership of the drill sound. After the drill sound gained traction, Chief Keef became the center of a bidding war among major labels. Ultimately, he signed a lucrative deal with Interscope Records, solidifying his position as the subgenre's leading star.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-trailblazing-a-genre><strong><strong>Trailblazing A Genre</strong></strong></h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But Chief Keef's influence extends far beyond the confines of the music industry. Using social media and connecting with fans directly enabled him to pave the way for internet-driven artists and the "SoundCloud rap" scene to emerge. As one of the first artists to leverage platforms like YouTube and Twitter to build a loyal following, he bypassed traditional industry gatekeepers to reach a wide audience. As the years passed, Chief Keef's impact on the sound of contemporary hip-hop has become undeniable. His distinctive style and raw lyricism are heard in the music of artists like YoungBoy Never Broke Again, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Uzi Vert</a>, Playboi Carti, as well as countless others.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The influence of Chief Keef goes beyond his music, as he also made an impact on fashion and pop culture. His dreadlocks, face tattoos, and minimalist style inspired a new wave of fashion trends. Meanwhile, his unique slang and catchphrases, such as "glow up" and "thot," have become part of the hip-hop lexicon. Since his breakthrough, drill music has evolved and spread around the world, with scenes emerging in London, Ghana, and Australia. Listeners can feel Chief Keef's impact in every gritty beat and raw lyric.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-influence-amp-legacy><strong>Influence</strong> & Legacy</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">new song "Drifting Away,"</a> Chief Keef defiantly takes a shot at Kanye West's perceived attempts to take credit for inventing drill music. He asserts, "Chief Sosa made drill; Kanye think he did, too." The lyrical jab emphasizes Chief Keef's status as the man responsible for the creation of the groundbreaking drill music movement himself. Despite West's claim, Chief Keef's defiant response serves as a reminder of his unwavering confidence and adamant stance as a hip-hop figurehead. A trailblazer, he subsequently helped create a musical style that continues to captivate audiences worldwide, inspiring a new generation of artists. Finally, Chief Keef's legacy is shaped by sincerity, innovation, and dedication to voicing the harsh realities of street life. With his music, Chief Keef leaves a lasting impression on hip-hop, solidifying his status as a true originator.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Ashley Turner brings her deep respect for the craft of hip-hop to her coverage of the genre as a staff writer for HotNewHipHop.com.
