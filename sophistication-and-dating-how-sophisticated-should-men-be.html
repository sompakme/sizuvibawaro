Sign up here.</p><p><strong>Wine Knowledge<br></strong></p><p>At a wedding a few weeks ago, I was sitting next to a girl I've been wanting to makeout with forever. I targeted this wedding as my time to shine, but I think my wine ignorance did me in.</p><p>My glass was almost empty, so a waiter came around and said:</p><p>"Would you like more Merlot?"</p><p>I said: "No that's OK, I'm actually drinking red."</p><p>The girl looked at me with that record scratch awkward look.</p><p>Later that evening, she was chatting with this sophisticated looking guy who was wearing a scarf.&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a3201/dating-gimmicks/>I think they spent the night together.</a>There's no doubt in my mind that guy knew that Merlot is red.</p><p>Honestly, most wine tastes the same to me. All I know is that I like red more than white.</p><p>On dates, I'm up front about knowing nothing about wine as soon as the menus are handed out. This isn't such a sin because many women enjoy picking out the wine when we go out.</p><p><strong>General Knowledge/Manners<br></strong></p><p>I'd probably fail a fancy dinner manners quiz.</p><p>I didn't get too much Manners 101 growing up. My dad would tell me to keep my elbows off the table, but to this day I still don't understand how one can eat or sit at a table without putting their elbows on that table at some point.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a2068/bad-first-date-foods/>I have enough discipline not to eat until everyone gets their food</a>, but I don't understand this rule-- I wouldn't care if people started before me.</p><p>No matter how hard I try, I never remember what utensil to pick up for each course-I think you're supposed to pick them up from the outside and work inward?</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a4328/awkard-food/>On dates, I must concentrate intensely to dine "correctly."</a></p><p>There are many cultural things that I don't know. For instance, at that wedding a few weekends ago, the "whole bridal party" was summoned to pose for a picture. I didn't budge. I thought I was in the "groom's party."&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a3683/wedding-meeting-women/>Apparently the "bridal party" means both bridesmaids and groomsmen.</a>&nbsp;I need to learn those little nuances-women seem to know these nuances naturally out of the womb.</p><p>Even those fancy French cuffs and cufflinks gave me trouble: it was truly an epic battle getting those things on correctly.</p><p><strong>Arts & Politics<br></strong></p><p>I'll never be one of those people who can quote Hemingway, though I wish I could. I know books and art that I'm interested in, but I don't learn about stuff I'm not interested in. I like Art Deco more than French Impressionism, but seems like I'd be more cultured if I knew French Impressionism.</p><p>I know stuff from the CNN homepage but I'm not in to politics, and I try to stay out of political arguments.</p><p>Whenever someone gets in my face and says: "do you know that so and so is happening in country X?" I say: "no I don't, and I don't know how to solve it."</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a2274/the-perfect-girl-081026/>I'm looking for a girl who is somewhat cultured, but still loves her box wine, because she'll be very much like me.</a>However, I've definitely been attracted to super preppy girls who triple my cultural knowledge.</p><p>It's easy to find people that are too cultured, or not cultured enough. Deep cultural knowledge can give you the appearance of being wealthy, but obviously there's no real correlation-- anyone can learn how to be "cultured".</p><p>Are any of my three deficiencies above deal breakers? Do you find yourself going for super cultured guys, or less cultured guys? Do you think a guy looks wealthier if he's cultured? What bad manners are pet peeves for you?</p><p>Follow me on Twitter:&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://twitter.com/richravens referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>twitter.com/richravens</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaKuVrXqtu9WeZppsY2h%2FcL%2FOqZ%2Biq6SesKLAyKilZpmemXqlrdOipaBn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-8-best-hair-diffusers-for-curly-hair.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 8 Best Hair Diffusers for Curly Hair</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sam-hornish-jr-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sam Hornish Jr. Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
