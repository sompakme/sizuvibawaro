That could either be a film or possibly a Disney+ series, that would finally welcome the next big baddie for Marvel. Howard Stern unintentionally dropped that nugget of information on his talk show during a moment he was unaware that his mic was still broadcasting to the world. Also, we did get to see a Reed Richards variant in Doctor Strange 2, so that could mean the Fantastic Four are sure to follow. This begs the question: who is going to portray one of Marvel’s best villains? Well, a fan by the name of bobby-art decided to pick Cillian Murphy of Peaky Blinders <a href=#>fame</a>. He even decided to create some quite convincing fan art. You can see the photo below:</p><p>What is interesting is that Cillian Murphy does have some experience in superhero films. He famously portrayed Dr. Jonathan Crane aka <a href=#>Scarecrow </a>in Batman Begins. He also reprised that same role in The Dark Knight Rises. So, it would make sense for the man to return to the fold of the genre. He would also be one of the few to transition from DC to Marvel in a live-action format. Apart from his iconic Peaky Blinders hair, we think Murphy looks spectacular as Victor Von Doom. Doctor Doom is arguably the most powerful being in Marvel’s continuity. He once killed Thanos with his hands in the comics. With the MCU needing the next big baddie, Doom would certainly fit in nicely.</p><p>The rights to the Fantastic Four, X-Men, and many other properties came rolling back to Marvel after Disney had purchased Fox. This has led fans to wonder when they would rightfully take their place within the MCU. As previously mentioned, we did get to see a variant of Reed Richards, which has filed speculation that a new Fantastic Four movie would be on the way. We certainly can’t have the Fantastic Four without Doctor Doom, as he is the rival of Richards. Cillian Murphy would be a fantastic villainous choice to lead Marvel into the next phase. Head honcho, Kevin Feige, did announce that the next villain would be revealed in the coming months.</p><p>Kang the Conquerer is also going to be a villain that is featured in many MCU projects. A variant of the villain was introduced in Loki, and he will be appearing as the main villain in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. However, it would be fantastic if he existed only to serve someone even more powerful, Doctor Doom. That was the case with Ronan in Guardians of the Galaxy, who ended up being a pawn of Thanos. Bring in, Cillian Murphy.</p><p>Cillian Murphy is going to have some <a href=#>free time</a> on his hands, as Peaky Blinders has officially wrapped up its <a href=#>final season</a>. He is certainly one of the finest actors in the world, and fans would welcome him with open arms in the MCU. What better way than to turn him into one of the most feared villains, Doctor Doom. We would be happy with this choice.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irlZp6pLXLpaCapl2iwrO8x7JkmqtdmbykwM6rZJ2nn6J7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shawty-lo-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shawty Lo Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nathan-lane-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nathan Lane Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
