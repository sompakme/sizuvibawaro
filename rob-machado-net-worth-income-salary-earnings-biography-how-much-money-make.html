Born on October 16, 1973 in Sydney, Australia, Rob Machado is an Australian-born American professional surfer from Cardiff-by-the-Sea, a neighbourhood in the city of Encinitas (San Diego County).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Machado graduated from San Dieguito High School and is well-known for his “laid-back” and easygoing demeanour, which he exhibits both in and out of the water. Despite the fact that he surfs on a contemporary tri-fin shortboard, he is still referred to as a “soul surfer.” This is mainly due to his soft-spoken, modest demeanour and indifference in the limelight, as well as his fluid surfing technique, which has earned him the moniker “Mr. Smoothy.” He is one of the most well-known goofy-foot surfers in the world today, and he has a lot of fans.&nbsp;</p><p>Rob has won a number of the most renowned competitions in professional surfing, including the Pipeline Masters (also known as the Triple Crown of Surfing) in Hawaii and the U.S. Open of Surfing, which is the biggest surfing tournament contested on the U.S. mainland. Despite the fact that it was his first Huntington Beach triumph, it followed on the heals of his victory in the 2006 Monster Energy Pro (which was also held at Pipeline on Oahu’s North Shore) in 200Rob was also a member of the “West” squad that took first place in the Summer X Games surfing tournament, known as “The Game,” which is held each year in Mexico.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Even though he is no longer a member of the WCT (World Championship Tour), he was once considered one of the top contenders before injuries started to plague him in recent years. Despite this, he has twice finished in the top three in the world rankings at the conclusion of the calendar year. Since retiring, he has focused his efforts on a small number of surfing events that are very dear to him. His appearances in surfing publications, as well as his movies and documentaries, help to keep him in the public eye. Each year, Rob hosts and takes part in a surf competition held at his home reef, the Rob Machado Surf Classic and Beach Fair.&nbsp;</p><p>The event includes demo sessions with Rob and other pros, as well as a lunchtime break during which Rob interacts with children and provides them with tips and advice on surfing. In a series of surf-related activities held over the course of the weekend, the tournament crowns the King and Queen of the Reef, who have achieved the greatest overall results. As of right now, Rob is still often named as a reader’s favourite in surf magazine surveys and is sponsored by a variety of companies, including Hurley, Reef, and Nixon.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Machado is a very close friend of paraplegic surfer Jesse Billauer of the Life Rolls On Foundation, and he has acted as an inspiration to him throughout his life. He appeared in the 2007 animated film “Surf’s Up” as “himself,” in the same way as Kelly Slater did. In 2009, he co-wrote and acted in the film The Drifter, in which he played himself. With Blake Lively, Machado was photographed in Cardiff and Encinitas, California, for Vogue magazine’s summer edition (June 2010). The images were shot in Cardiff and the surrounding area. As a surf champion, Machado was selected for induction into the Surfing Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, California, in the class of 2011.</p><h2>Rob Machado Net Worth : $ 1.4 Million</h2><p>Lets check out updated 2021 Rob Machado Net Worth Income Salary report which is given below :</p><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><b>Rob Machado’s Salary /&nbsp;</b></span><b>Income</b><b>:</b><p><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Year:</b>&nbsp;$ 4,00,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Month:</b>&nbsp;$ 32,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><br></span><span><b>Per Week:</b>&nbsp;$ 8,000</span></span><br><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><span><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'><br></span></span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><table><tbody><tr><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Day:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Hour:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Minute:</span></b></td><td><b><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>Per Second:</span></b></td></tr><tr><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 1140</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 19</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 0.3</span></td><td><span face='"verdana" , sans-serif'>$ 0.05</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Rob Machado Wiki</h2><span>﻿﻿﻿﻿</span><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 16, 1973</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5′ 10″ (1.78 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Writer, Soundtrack</td></tr><tr><td>Residence</td><td>San Diego, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Rob Machado, Machado, Rob</td></tr><tr><td>Star Sign</td><td>Libra</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Rob Machado FAQ</h2><ul><li>How did Rob Machado get so rich?</li><li>What is Rob Machado Earning per day ?</li><li>Lets check out Rob Machado Wife / Husand Net Worth ?</li><li>How much does Rob Machado make per day?</li><li>How much Rob Machado Net Worth ?</li><li>How Rob Machado become rich ?</li><li>How does Rob Machado make money ?</li><li>What is Rob Machado Income ?</li><li>How much Rob Machado Salary ?</li><li>How old is Rob Machado Age ?</li><li>How tall is Rob Machado Height ?</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZnxxhY6rpptlnZawqa3DqGSnnaRixLC%2B06FkoqaTpLqmedKao5qqqWKyor7NoqWgq12XtrCz0ZqnobFdnby4ecyumqFlnaS7psWMppiknV6dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robin-roberts-announces-huge-career-news-that-gets-fans-talking.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Robin Roberts announces huge career news that gets fans talking</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rich-dollaz-admits-to-loving-erica-mena-in-family-reunion-preview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rich Dollaz Admits To Loving Erica Mena In &amp;quot;Family Reunion Preview</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
