The oldest of five siblings, she grew up in the Fordham Road neighborhood, surrounded by a family deeply entrenched in the rhythms of the city and the world of music. Her father, a former underground rapper of African-American descent, and her Dominican mother, who was only 17 when Isis was born, set the stage for the young artist's immersion into hip-hop. She took a liking to the genre at age seven, inspired by industry heavyweights such as Lil' Kim, Nicki Minaj, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, and Wu-Tang Clan​.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-poetry-and-freestyle-raps>Poetry And Freestyle Raps</h2></span><p>Her passion for hip-hop and her knack for rhyming led her to write poetry and freestyle raps from elementary school through high school, often typing out lyrics on her iPhone and rapping along to hip-hop instrumentals. The moniker Ice Spice was chosen in her freshman year of high school, a name that would soon resonate with millions​.</p><p>Ice Spice's journey into higher education took her to the State University of New York at Purchase, where she studied communications and was a part of the school's <a href=# rel>volleyball team</a>. However, she decided to drop out in her sophomore year, recognizing that she was not in the right place. She instead set her sights firmly on her music career, a decision that would prove pivotal​.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-first-big-break>First Big Break</h2></span><p>The first major step in Ice Spice's career came in 2021 when she met record producer RiotUSA. Her initial breakthrough followed in 2022 with the viral hit "Munch (Feelin' U)," which caught fire on TikTok. Successive singles "<a href=# rel>Bikini Bottom</a>" and "In Ha Mood" paved the way to her debut extended play, Like..? in 2023. Her collaboration with Lil Tjay, "Gangsta Boo", marked her first entry into the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, while remix singles, "Boy's a Liar Pt. 2" with PinkPantheress and "Princess Diana" with Nicki Minaj charted within the top five of the Hot 100​.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ice-spice-rap-s-new-princess>Ice Spice: "Rap's New Princess"</h2></span><p>Ice Spice's relaxed rapping style set her apart, with publications such as The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Billboard </a>dubbing her "rap's new princess." This notoriety was further cemented when she broke a Spotify record previously held by Nicki Minaj. As a guest feature on <a href=# rel>Taylor Swift's "Karma (Remix)"</a>, Ice Spice earned the biggest streaming debut for a female rapper in global Spotify history, reaching over 5 million streams on its release day and nearly doubling her total Spotify streams​​.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-future>Future</h2></span><p>With her trailblazing successes, Ice Spice is redefining the boundaries of hip-hop. As a queer artist, she brings a unique perspective to her music, evident in songs like "Bikini Bottom". Whether working as a cashier at Wendy's and The Gap or creating chart-topping hits, Ice Spice is a testament to the power of following your passion and staying true to yourself​.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmegp7yntcueZqKblWLAsbXCng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristi-lynn-carpenter-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kristi Lynn Carpenter Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-saved-n14-9m-in-6-months-man-starts-living-in-his-car-avoids-paying-high-rent-in-america.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I Saved N14.9m in 6 Months: Man Starts Living in His Car, Avoids Paying High Rent in America</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
