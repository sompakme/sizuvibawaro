Back in 2016, she openly revealed she liked having a bowl-style haircut when she was younger. While growing up, everyone she knew experimented with their hair so it’s no wonder January dared to try out different looks. She wrote for Marie Claire: “When I was younger, my hair was white, and I liked wearing it short—boy cuts and the bowl cut with the wedge. One of my favorites I called The Spike; it was really short and I would spike up the slightly longer hairs on top with Dep gel. I remember going to school with The Spike, and three weeks later, my fourth-grade teacher, Miss Palmer, copied me. Then I had to change my hairstyle. I was over it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fd0adcf963fc-january-jones-bob.jpg><p id=eb4BYnc_l50 data-wc=73>“People were just more experimental with their hair when I was growing up. I was influenced by Madonna, Blondie, and the punks, but I never had a mohawk. One time, my mom permed my bangs so I wouldn't have to curl them every morning—that turned out really bad. The second half of junior high, I grew out my hair and kept it straight and long until I moved to New York at 18.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/88093259300d-january-jones-with-pink-hair.jpg><p id=eOHk0o4xbid data-wc=106>As she grew up, January found changing her hair helped transform her into her on-screen characters. She previously told <strong></strong>: "I always try to collaborate with the hairstylist about what my character would have and try very hard not to let vanity stop me from a realistic interpretation. Hair, along with make-up and costumes, is a really exciting way of forming a visual idea of a character. It can also really help you feel like a different person." We have seen January wear her hair platinum, dark brown, red and golden over the years - and we can’t wait to see what she tries out next!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e2a1e684f4c6-january-jones-white-bikini.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7ccc2805bcf3-january-jones-t.jpg><p id=eeF6s5w2nv data-wc=6><strong>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
