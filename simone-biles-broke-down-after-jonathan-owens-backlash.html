"And then I go on Twitter and everybody's like, 'Divorce this man, he's mean,'" she recalled. "And I'm like, he's the sweetest. He praises the ground that I walk on. Like truly, I've never met a man like him."</p><p>The athlete also felt her husband's words had been misinterpreted on social media.</p><p>"And he never said I wasn't a catch," she said. "He said he was a catch because he is. I've never met a man like him. A lot of people that meet him are like, 'Oh my gosh, like I want a man like that, like Jonathan.'"</p><p>Biles also explained that this was an interview with Owens not her, and that she's happy for him to take the spotlight and to support him when he does.</p><p>Unfortunately, the backlash ended up getting to the gymnast, even though she originally found the situation funny.</p><p>"I thought it was hilarious what people were saying," she said. "'Divorce him. Divorce him.' All this crazy stuff."</p><p>She continued, "So I thought it was hilarious at first and then they hurt my feelings. And then like one night I broke down and I'm like, 'Why are you guys talking about my husband like this?' Like you don't know him, you don't know who he is, and if anybody's met him, they know he's the sweetest guy and will do anything for anybody.</p><p>"And so that really hurt that they were talking about my husband like that.<br>Because for me, it's like, talk about me all you want, but don't come for my family.
