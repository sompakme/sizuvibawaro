This is for continental US states. Standard shipping will cost $8.95 for orders of less than $75. Your order will usually arrive within 5-8 working days. Check our page for free shipping coupons and promo codes as well.&nbsp;</p><h3>Can I get an email discount at Red Dress?</h3><p>Yes. Red Dress has a 15% off discount when you sign up for their newsletter emails. You’ll also stay updated on the latest promotions, sales, and products from Red Dress. To sign up, go to the Red Dress website, scroll to the footer, and type your preferred email address. &nbsp;</p><h3>Does Red Dress have sales?</h3><p>Yes. You can shop their dedicated ‘Sale’ page on the Red Dress website. We’ve previously seen discounts of up to 80% off with the sale. Whether you’re shopping for swimwear or dresses, it’s worth going to the sale first for a discount.&nbsp;</p><h3>What is the return policy at Red Dress?</h3><p>Red Dress has a 30-day return policy from the date of delivery. Your items should be returned in their original condition with any tags attached. Shoes must be returned in their original shoe boxes. Returns cannot be made for Final Sale. Your refund will be a store credit, not the original payment method. &nbsp;</p><h2 id=hints-and-tips-3>Hints and Tips</h2><p><strong>Stylish Sale Fashion: </strong>One thing that never goes out of fashion? Finding a good saving on your order. We all love knowing we are stocking up on designer labels or stylish apparel for less than its original price. You can shop the Sale section at Red Dress for strong percentage discounts on jackets, sweaters, and shirts. While the sale page is available throughout the year, it’s worth remembering there are annual sales at Red Dress too. These usually have stronger discounts than most times of the year. Make sure to check the ‘Last Ones’ category in the sale as these items are usually popular and sell out quickly. Pick up last-minute deals on everything from jackets and sweatshirts to mugs and country boots.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Save on Swimwear: </strong>If you’re looking to stock up on swimwear for your next holiday, then it’s worth checking Red Dress for affordable bikinis and swimsuits. We’d recommend clicking the ‘Swimwear Under $50’ category, which you can find by clicking ‘Swim’. With classic one-pieces and floral bikinis, you can shop whichever style suits you at Red Dress. It’s worth knowing some pieces do go into a ‘Waitlist’ so make sure to shop them whilst they are still on sale. You can also shop by designer swim brands such as Beach Riot and L’Space.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Affordable Shipping: </strong>Orders of $100 or more at Red Dress qualify for free ground US shipping. Your order will be delivered within 5-8 working days. If your order is less than $100, standard shipping costs are $8.95. Do you need your order sooner? You can always choose Priority Shipping for $12.95. Your order will usually be delivered within 4-5 working days instead. There are also Express Shipping, Next-Day Air, and International shipping options available if needed.</p><p><strong>Join the Red Dress Newsletter: </strong>Why not sign up for the Red Dress mailing list? You can get 15% off your first order by subscribing. Red Dress will also send you the latest sale information and keep you updated when new products are added. To subscribe to their newsletter, simply go to the Red Dress website. You can then scroll down to the footer and enter your email address where it says ‘Sign Up for Emails and Get 15% Off’. You can always use the relevant Red Dress promo code on this page instead.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lucky Deals: </strong>If you’re feeling lucky, go to the Red Dress website and you might be able to win a discount. Red Dress occasionally has a pop-up ‘Spin-to-Win’ wheel, with discounts of 5-15% off your order. All you need to do is click the ‘Spin’ button in the middle of the wheel. You’re guaranteed to land a discount, even if it’s not 15% off. Make sure to double-check the terms and conditions as these promotions usually can only be used on your first purchase.</p><li>Choose your Red Dress promo code from Marie Claire.</li><li>Click the ‘Get Coupon’ and then ‘Get Offer at Red Dress.’</li><li>You should then be automatically redirected to Red Dress.&nbsp;</li><li>Add your favorite clothing to your bag.</li><li>Next, choose ‘Secure Checkout’ to go to your checkout page.</li><li>Find the ‘Gift Card or Discount Code’ promo code box.</li><li>Copy and paste your Red Dress promo code into the box.</li><li>Click ‘Apply’ and Red Dress should automatically add your discount.</li><h2 id=how-we-source-our-codes-3>How We Source Our Codes</h2><p>At Marie Claire, we have a dedicated team of deal experts, commercial colleagues, and editors who find and negotiate the best promo codes and coupons, as well as produce content aiming to help you shop affordably.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a dedicated team of 3 deal experts that are constantly sourcing and testing coupons and promo codes for some of the biggest retailers in fashion, beauty, and beyond to list on our website.
