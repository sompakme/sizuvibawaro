Copenhagen Fashion Week was the latest stop on the prep revival’s world tour, with a strong showing of striped button-downs throughout the week.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wearing a selection of my own striped button-downs in the front row, I saw designers half-tucking their versions into generously cut suit sets or flinging them simply over a swimsuit. It was a demonstration of how well the Danes understand how women really dress—they just get chic practicality. With each shirt that appeared on the runway, I imagined creative directors reminding me that what I already own is worthy of re-wearing and restyling. A directional take I loved appeared at Wood Wood, where a model was dressed in two oversize shirts at once, one over the shoulders and the other tied around the waist—plus matching pants.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-1ooignj emevuu60">Copenhagen Spring 2024 Trend: Spangled Second Skin</h2><img alt="a model at remain wears a waxed shirt and sequin mini skirt" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ss24-copenhagenfashionweek-rotate-runway-atjamescochranephoto-2x3-22-64da6a271883e.jpg title="Copenhagen Spring 2024 Fashion Trends" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">MatchesFashion senior buyer Ferrar was all about the “effortless and uplifting” mood at Ganni, where she noted “delicate sequins were styled back to denim [and] their silver sequin gown was a highlight.” It wasn’t the only runway that made an entire room shimmer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For spring 2024, designers showed that glitter also has range, and I liked seeing sparkles break free of one -core aesthetic. There were small sequin-coated halter dresses with a striped underlay at Saks Potts, latticework pants at Kernemilk, and skirts of all lengths—mini at Rotate, midi at Baum und Pferdgarten, and maxi at Rotate. All the looks were elevated, but they veered from preppy with slouchy cardigans to rock ’n’ roll with hot pants and leather jackets.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Copenhagen Spring 2024 Trends: The Workwear Remix<br></h2><img alt="a model wears a suit with a peplum skirt in a guide to spring 2024 fashion trends" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ss24-copenhagenfashionweek-mark-kenly-domino-tan-runway-atjamescochranephoto-2x3-14-64da7161cc77c.jpg title="Copenhagen Spring 2024 Fashion Trends" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Over the past few seasons, suit sets have taken over every fashion week. Fashion is but one of many industries still adjusting to a post-Covid world, and a number of collections have explored how we want to present ourselves IRL to our coworkers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Designers at Copenhagen Fashion Week have definitely been designing for office life, with a handful of runways showing blazers and smart skirts or trousers. But designers presented officewear on their terms, such as with an unconventional peplum skirt and cropped blazer jacket over a shirt dress at Mark Kenly Domino Tan, or a khaki suit broken up by a knitted skirt at Lovechild 1979. Embellishments dressed up stark black and slightly revealing suiting at Ganni and Stine Goya. I couldn’t help but grin when I saw Remain’s twist on the spring work dress: a strapless number that looked like a stretched-out pleated skirt, paired simply with slouchy leather boots. These were looks that meant business without losing their sense of fun.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Copenhagen Spring 2024 Trend: The Big Shorts<br></h2><img alt="a model at paulina russo wears long denim shots with a corset top" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ss24-copenhagenfashionweek-paolina-russo-runway-atjamescochranephoto-2x3-1-64da63525b5ed.jpg title="Copenhagen Spring 2024 Fashion Trends" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If Copenhagen’s designers have their way, summer won’t be synonymous with tiny cutoff shorts for much longer. I noticed a consensus in favor of longer, looser shorts, grazing models’ kneecaps at Marimekko, Baum und Pferdgarten, and Paolina Russo. It could be a practical push—Danish summers involve a lot of biking and chillier temperatures. But the silhouette also invites juxtaposing proportions, as evidenced by designers’ tendency to pair their longer shorts with a strapless top or a cropped jacket.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Copenhagen Spring 2024 Trend: Skirts Over Pants</h2><img alt="a model wears a silk dress over pants at the saks potts spring 2024 fashion show" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ss24-copenhagenfashionweek-saks-potts-2x3-22-64da5f0abc9fb.jpg title="Copenhagen Spring 2024 Fashion Trends" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I stopped by Saks Potts’ showroom for a second look at its spring 2024 collection, one member of the team was dressed in a reworking of two runway pieces: a sage-green satin dress pulled over a pair of white pants. The wearer told me the dresses-over-pants look is common in Denmark at the height of summer. By this time next year, it might just have gone global.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Another trend that stood out was layering skirts over wide trousers, both matching and in contrast,” Petersson of Browns told me. I had to agree: Designers throughout the week seemed adamant that skirts and dresses over fluid-leg trousers were an absolutely necessary styling trick. TG Botanical, the Garment, Saks Potts, and others presented them so convincingly that I planned to try the look myself at home. By the end of the week, I’d forgotten that a dress over pants could be anything but elevated.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Copenhagen Spring 2024 Trend: Abstract Printed Denim</h2><img alt="a model at gestuz wears printed denim in a guide to spring 2024 fashion trends" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ss24-copenhagenfashionweek-gestuz-runway-atjamescochranephoto-2x3-8-jpg-64da68f51c3e3.jpg title="Copenhagen Spring 2024 Fashion Trends" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After covering Copenhagen Fashion Week for a few seasons, I’ve come to expect a strong showing of jeans and denim-on-denim outfits. (The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://crfashionbook.com/fashion-a27240012-national-denim-day-canadian-tuxedo-history/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Canadian tuxedo" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Canadian tuxedo</a> is just as prevalent in Denmark.) The big question is how designers will make the democratic fabric feel new.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This season, the answer was illustration. At Gestuz, two denim looks came coated in thin, wavy brushstrokes—like a painted apparition of upscale utility on the runway. Stine Goya lightly stamped its curved logo all over a denim flightsuit and a jacket-plus-miniskirt combo, creating its own undulating look. The trend continued later in the week at Paolina Russo, with jackets and extra-long shorts faded, painted, and printed with abstract designs. Ganni closed the week with a top and jeans splashed in a watercolor blend of indigo, pale blue, and white.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Copenhagen Spring 2024 Trend: Keeping It Transparent</h2><img alt="a model at a roege hove wears a sheer top and sheer pencil skirt in a guide to spring 2024 trends" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ss24-copenhagenfashionweek-a-roegehove-runway-1-64da6cc72a2c3.jpg title="Copenhagen Spring 2024 Fashion Trends" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My approach to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a43532183/how-to-wear-sheer-clothes/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wearing sheer clothes" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">wearing sheer clothes</a> usually involves an extra layer underneath, both for modesty and for contrast.

Variations in color and detailing are where the trend got exciting: In one of my favorite looks, OpéraSport showed a lacelike sheer dress embroidered with flowers over a pair of oversize black slacks—a trend within a trend.</p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Copenhagen Spring 2024 Trend: Car Coats and Trenches</h2><img alt="a model at lovechild 1979 wears a trench coat with black layers" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ss24-copenhagenfashionweek-lovechild-runway-atjamescochranephoto-2x3-22-64da6b6a72da0.jpg title="Copenhagen Spring 2024 Fashion Trends" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a44761022/best-oversized-coats/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="best oversize coats" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">best oversize coats</a> were a fixture in Copenhagen street style this season; on the runways, designers prepared us for inter-season layering with a mix of updated trench coats and light jackets. Brands with a minimalist bent dialed up the proportions of classic khaki versions, scaling up their sleeves and hems at Mark Kenly Domino Tan and neatly cropping them with a relaxed fit at Lovechild 1979. Then there were the spring jackets that embraced the season with always-seasonally-appropriate pastel shades at Rolf Ekroth, the Garment, and Baum und Pferdgarten. When your outer layers look this good, you don’t have to worry about covering up the rest of your outfit—a reminder the rain-soaked crowd wanted to hear during an unusually stormy week.</p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Copenhagen Spring 2024 Trend: Geometric Statement Jewelry</h2><img alt="a model wears silver earrings on the gestuz runway at copenhagen spring 2024 fashion trends" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ss24-copenhagenfashionweek-gestuz-backstage-attonyamatyu-27-64da613555a59.jpg title="Copenhagen Spring 2024 Fashion Trends" width=1000 height=1249 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I wear the same two pairs of mini huggie hoops and a stack of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/g40038561/dainty-necklaces/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dainty necklaces" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">dainty necklaces</a> on a daily basis. As I packed my jewelry into my travel case before flying back to New York City, I wondered if spring 2024 would be the season my jewelry stack goes big. Collections throughout Copenhagen Fashion Week scaled up their accessories with exaggerated drop studs at Stine Goya, chunky brass hoops at Lovechild 1979, and silver earrings that could double for miniature abstract statues at Gestuz. Their oversize shapes played off the exaggerated proportions of loose suiting and oversize dress-and-skirt combinations—convincing me that bigger really is better.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Halie LeSavage is the fashion commerce editor at Harper's BAZAAR.
