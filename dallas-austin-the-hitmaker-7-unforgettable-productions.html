The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned widespread acclaim for its lyrics. Furthermore, the music video for the song has become one of the most popular R&B videos of all time.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In an interview with Claudia Jordan on Out Loud with Claudia Jordan, Austin recounted how the song came to be. “…when I was writing for a girl, I knew how to write things they wouldn’t necessarily say on their sleeve but how they felt.” he said. “She would say, ‘I cheated on you. I didn’t want to but I just needed some attention. You weren’t there for me so I had to creep... You would have crept out too.”&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-the-boy-is-mine-brandy-and-monica-1998>“The Boy Is Mine” - <a href=# class=text-word>Brandy</a> and Monica (1998)</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The iconic 1998 single, “The Boy Is Mine,” had all the markings of a sure fire hit.

This undoubtedly fueled the overwhelming success of the song.
