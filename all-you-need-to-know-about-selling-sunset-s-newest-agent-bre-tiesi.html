Netflix's hugely popular reality show has welcomed back the familiar faces and agents of the luxury real estate agency The Oppenheim Group, but, as usual, it's not just the extra outfits and sprawling hilltop mansions that make the show – it's the drama between the cast.</p><p id=esSOJCKLEOn data-wc=44>And as well as our favorite Selling Sunset stars such as Chrishell Stause, Mary Fitzgerald and Chelsea Lazkani, there are some newbies in town. We're, of course, sad to see that Christine Queen and Maya Vander have not made a return to the show.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Selling Sunset is back for season six</figure><p id=eE9QFphd2W data-wc=62>After plenty of drama in series six involving one of Emma's clients, Christine has not been allowed back into the O Group. Meanwhile, Maya is taking a break for maternity leave. Naturally, then, the agency had some vacancies to fill. <strong data-gid=e4pdSPU01qX>One of the new agents is Bre Tiesi</strong>, who made quite the impression when she made her debut in the sixth season.</p><p id=ezc1WgufNTI data-wc=25>So, who is Bre? She has had quite a career in real estate and she has some famous connections. <strong>Here's all you need to know…</strong></p><h2>Who is Selling Sunset's newest agent, Bre Tiesi?</h2><p id=eoCuTZo2lfa data-wc=31>Bre Tiesi is a model-turned-real-estate agent. The 32-year-old was born and raised in Los Angeles and got her first modeling gig when she was a teenager fresh out of high school.</p><p id=eCPlFDa-k6 data-wc=15><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Exclusive photos: Selling Sunset's Mary Fitzgerald is a beach babe on delayed Romain honeymoon</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=er51H54iCsF data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Exclusive: Inside Selling Sunset's Vanessa's sentimental honeymoon - and why co-stars did not attend wedding</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a8c4631609f2-heather-bre-selling-sunset.jpg><p id=e4lfv3gDX8w data-wc=50>As the reality star explained in the show, she gained her real estate license in 2017 but has been working full-time as an agent since 2020 and has managed to gain a roster of highly wealthy and exclusive clients, raking in nearly $20 million in her first year of selling.</p><p id=eMOwlBSrxuJ data-wc=70>Prior to joining the Oppenheim Group, Bre worked as an agent at a rival company, Keller Williams Beverly Hills. Chatting with PEOPLE in 2022 about transitioning from modeling to selling luxury homes, she said: "I wanted to transition out of modeling and start setting myself up for a long-term career. I started taking it more seriously and tapping into my network, and that's when I started making some high-figure sales."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d483edd703b7-bre-and-chelsea-selling-sunset.jpg><p id=ej5kCagCz41 data-wc=34>She added: "As amazing as modeling was as an industry for me, I was just kind of over it. You know, I'm 31 now. So, I'm like, it's time to be a big girl!"</p><h2>Is Bre Tiesi married?</h2><p id=eTjBqMsHMWh data-wc=53>Bre Tiesi is not currently married but was previously married to professional NFL player Johnny Manziel. The pair began dating in 2016 and tied the knot in a private ceremony in 2018. However, a year later, the couple split, and Bre filed for divorce in late 2019. In 2021, their divorce was finalized.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<h2>Does Bre Tiesi have children?</h2><p id=ecja149xiyj data-wc=60>Yes! Bre has mentioned on the show that she's extremely proud to be a mother-of-one. In July 2022, the real estate agent welcomed her son, Legendary Love Cannon, with TV star Nick Cannon. Although Legendary is Bre's first child, he is Nick's eighth, and the Wild 'n Out host famously welcomed four more children the same year Legendary was born.</p><p id=el6zV1frg_ data-wc=34>Bre has described the father of her child as a "beautiful soul" and "the best daddy", and has had nothing but praise for the TV star since they welcomed their child together last year.</p><p id=eBO0HczN2fM data-wc=72>She told the Daily Pop in March 2022: "[We] have a beautiful relationship [where] everything is so supportive and positive. Him and I have had our on-and-off for years. And I just respect and love who he is so much as a person, that when I thought about, 'Do I want my son to be this person? Look at your characteristics, look at your personality, look at how you treat people.'
