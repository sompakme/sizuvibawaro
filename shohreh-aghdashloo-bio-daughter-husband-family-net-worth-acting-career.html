family.&nbsp;Her marriage was dissolved in 1979 without any children involved.&nbsp;It was at the same time that she immigrated to England, just at the beginning of the Iranian revolution.&nbsp;Shohreh eventually earned a bachelor’s degree in international relations after attending Brunel University.&nbsp;From that moment, she began an acting career.&nbsp;In 1987, the actress linked again with actor Houshang Touzie.&nbsp;The Iranian-American chronicled her life and events in her autobiography titled&nbsp;</span><span>The Alley of Love and Yellow
