Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. A jury trial was set to start Feb. 20.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The legal battle revolved around claims that Kirkman duped Crabtree into surrendering his ownership stake under the guise of making the title easier to sell to studios. The 2005 agreement stated that Kirkman was the “sole author” of Invincible and “owner of all rights of every kind and nature,” while characterizing Crabtree’s contributions as a “work-for-hire,” meaning that Kirkman was assigned any rights the colorist would’ve had to the series.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In November, a federal judge narrowed the scope of the case but allowed key claims to move forward. U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong <a href=#>ruled</a> that Crabtree won’t be able to seek a court order that he’s a joint author or get damages for fraud but could possibly invalidate the contract he claims he was swindled into signing.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Kirkman could have been on the hook for massive damages if a jury found that he breached an oral agreement to pay Crabtree 10 percent of any revenue generated from film or TV spinoffs of the work, which includes the <a href=#>Amazon Studios</a> animated show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Lawyers for both sides didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Kirkman was represented by Tim Henderson and Allen Grodsky, while Crabtree was represented by Devin McRae and Peter Scott.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Crabtree’s suit nodded to a complaint brought against Kirkman in 2012 by Michael “Tony” Moore, who claimed he was entitled to as much as half of the proceeds from the Walking Dead comic book franchise. The comic creator was accused of tricking Moore, whose lawyer was also McRae, into giving up his interest in the comic and demanded a rescission of the copyright assignment. Under their original deal, Moore was allegedly entitled to 60 percent of “comic publishing net proceeds,” 20 percent of “motion picture net proceeds” and further financial interest in other projects. Kirkman countersued, arguing that he had overcompensated Moore for his work and was entitled to money back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmoqamnruktcGlnGaooqSzqsDSZqqhp6eZvLi6jKycq6GVqHqww82eqaygmaV6prrDrGSsnaSpuaa5xKerZmliaIJ5fJZsbmpn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./secrets-of-the-dead-preview-the-princes-in-the-tower-season-21-episode-3.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Secrets of the Dead | Preview | The Princes in the Tower | Season 21 | Episode 3</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./%E5%86%B0%E8%88%87%E7%81%AB%E4%B9%8B%E6%AD%8C-%E6%AC%8A%E5%8A%9B%E9%81%8A%E6%88%B2-%E5%8F%B2%E5%A1%94%E5%85%8B%E5%85%84%E5%A6%B9%E7%B5%82%E6%96%BC%E9%87%8D%E9%80%A2-%E8%98%87%E8%8F%B2%E7%89%B9%E7%B4%8D%E8%88%87%E7%90%86%E5%AF%9F%E9%BA%A5%E7%99%BB%E6%96%BCmet.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Met</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
