The Utah remains on the Pearl Harbor floor along with the Arizona. The Oklahoma was raised after a massive effort but proved to be too damaged to return to service.<h2>Can you dive to the USS Arizona?</h2>Because the Arizona is considered to be a memorial, it is unlawful for divers to enter the ship, so careful egresses are made using underwater rovers that document interior conditions. Members of PVA dive the waters of the USS Arizona along with the National Park Service.<h2>Who was the last person interred on the USS Arizona?</h2>Lauren Bruner is the last survivor of the USS Arizona to have his remains interred on the submerged ship in Pearl Harbor.

Using DNA taken from a nephew, the Pentagon was finally able to identify the remains of the 25-year-old sailor in 2020.<h2>Are there still bodies in the USS Oklahoma?</h2>After years of planning, an announcement was made by DPAA that all Oklahoma remains would be exhumed and DNA tested for identification.
