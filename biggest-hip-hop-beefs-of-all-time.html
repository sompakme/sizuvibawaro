Since the fateful events of the late 1990s involving <a href=# rel>Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G.</a>, hip-hop culture has seen its share of heated disputes and alliances – from business disagreements to regional loyalties, romantic entanglements, envy, allegiance, and reputation. Here are the biggest hip hop beefs of all time.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-cardi-b-vs-nicki-minaj>10. <a href=# class=text-word>Cardi B</a> vs. Nicki Minaj</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - MAY 07: Nicki Minaj, Designer Jeremy Scott, and Cardi B attend the Heavenly Bodies: Fashion & The Catholic Imagination Costume Institute Gala at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 7, 2018 in New York City. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/MG18/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue)</p><p>In a radical change from the past, New York Fashion Week saw the apex of an enduring conflict between musicians <a href=# rel>Cardi B and Nicki Minaj</a>. Despite collaborative efforts on tracks and public displays of affection for one another via various social media, whispers of ill-will circulated for years. The altercation at Fashion Week validated these rumors, escalating things to slanderous outbursts over the airwaves and Instagram, as well as involving shoe designer Steve Madden and even the 2018 gubernatorial race in New York. This dispute shows no signs of abating.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-meek-mill-vs-drake>9. Meek Mill vs. Drake&nbsp;</h2></span><p>ATLANTA, GA - JUNE 15: DJ Drama, Drake and Meek Mill attend the Birthday Bash Afterparty featuring Meek Mill, DJ Drama and French Montana at Mansion Elan on June 15, 2013 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Photo by Prince Williams/FilmMagic)</p><p>Meek Mill accused Drake of <a href=# rel>not writing his own lyrics</a> for "Dreams Money Can Buy," prompting Drizzy to issue a diss track titled "Charged Up." Not content with this measure, Drake then released the banger "Back to Back," which made references to Nicki Minaj without mentioning Meek. He followed up with "Summer Sixteen," yet Meek got one final chance at retaliation with "War Pain." However, soon after Meek's prison release in 2018, the two united for the collaborative single "Going Bad," an experience that Drake described as very rewarding.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-50-cent-vs-ja-rule>8. 50 Cent vs. <a href=# class=text-word>Ja Rule</a></h2></span><p>Another one of the biggest beefs in hip hop involved two successful New York rappers, <a href=# rel>50 Cent and Ja Rule</a>. The feud started after one of 50 Cent's associates allegedly stole Ja Rule's chain, sparking a long-standing rivalry between the two artists. This inciting incident resulted in a physical altercation at an Atlanta nightclub, ultimately leading to 50 being stabbed when Ja and Black Child visited The Hit Factory.&nbsp;</p><p>In response, 50 dropped "Wanksta," mocking Ja's label Murder Inc. 50 then dragged others into the beef on "I Smell P#ssy" and "Back Down," calling them out for their lack of street cred. Ja fought back with "Loose Change," where he insulted many high-profile celebrities, whilst Fiddy's fame soared and overshadowed efforts from Murder Inc.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-ice-cube-vs-common>7. Ice Cube vs. <a href=# class=text-word>Common</a></h2></span><p>Ice Cube ignited a <a href=# rel>fierce feud with Common</a> after the latter criticized the West Coast's shift from pro-/black to gangsta rap. Undeniably talented, Common retaliated with “The Bitch in You,” calling out Cube for daring to take on the whole coast. The Midwest MC upheld his lyrical might: “Ain’t made nothin' dope since AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted,” signaling he had no intention of backing down. But in a short but powerful battle, Cube proved that nice guys don't always finish last (as Drake can attest).</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-50-cent-vs-the-game>6. 50 Cent vs. The Game</h2></span><p>One of the biggest beefs in hip hop during the mid-2000s was the highly-publicized rivalry between <a href=# rel>50 Cent and The Game</a>. Despite rumors that the feud was simply a publicity stunt, it still caused a stir within the hip hop community. Diss tracks, payback, and resulting fury followed for months until 2016, when the quarrel eventually concluded at Ace of Diamonds Strip Club in Los Angeles. Despite speculation, 50 Cent's unrivaled business savvy remains unchallenged. The pair continue to throw verbal jabs at one another on social media.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-ll-cool-j-vs-canibus>5. LL Cool J vs. Canibus</h2></span><p>LL Cool J is a jovial individual these days, radiating joy and confidence in his accomplishments. Lucky for him! But it's amusing to recall when LL had an outright militant veneer while embroiled in his long-running feud with famed battle rapper, Canibus. He was integral to the two-decade-long dispute initiated by LL's perception that Cool J had been insulted on "4,3,2,1." Then in 1998, Canibus thoughtlessly taunted with his only Top 40 single, "Second Round K.O.," which earned a rebuttal from LL via "The Ripper Strikes Back" and "Back Where I Belong." Fortunately, the two reconciled their differences at the 2014 Christmas in Brooklyn event.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-lil-wayne-vs-birdman>4. Lil Wayne vs. Birdman</h2></span><p>Rapper Birdman and Lil Wayne attend 14th Annual Soul Train Music Awards on March 4, 2000 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)</p><p>One of the biggest beefs in hip hop was the longstanding feud between <a href=# rel>Lil Wayne and his mentor, Birdman</a>. The tension had been building up for years, but it reached a point where it felt like a tragic situation for the music scene in New Orleans. Birdman had been instrumental in Lil Wayne's rise to fame and success as one of the most influential rappers of his generation. But by 2015, their relationship was beyond repair; Wayne had accused Birdman of withholding his 12th album, Tha Carter V, and dissed him on Sorry 4 The Wait 2, a mixtape released instead. He even went so far as to file a lawsuit against Birdman for money mismanagement and threatened to take Drake and Nicki Minaj away from Cash Money Records with him.&nbsp;</p><p>In July 2015, prosecutors suggested something unthinkable at its darkest hour: Birdman and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Young Thug</a> had <a href=# rel>conspired to murder Lil Wayne</a>. Yet somehow, in the coming years, these two managed to reconcile and put their differences aside, continuing their working relationship into 2020. Still, the alleged murder attempt remains a focus in the current<a href=# rel> RICO case against Young Thug.</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-eazy-e-vs-dr-dre>3. Eazy-E vs. Dr. Dre</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK--DECEMBER 08: Dr. Dre (aka Andre Romelle Young ) and Eazy-E (aka Eric Lynn Wright) of the Rap group N.W.A. appear in a portrait taken on December 8, 1989 in New York City. (Photo by Al Pereira/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)</p><p>After a painful breakup, former NWA members<a href=# rel> Eazy-E and Dr. Dre</a> went back and forth, hurling insults at one another. With the release of "Dre's Day" from Dre, it seemed he had secured victory. However, Eazy retaliated with his track “Real Muthaf–kin’ Gs.” Eazy lambasted both Dre and Snoop for allegedly never being exposed to true ghetto life. He even took jabs at Dre's past involvement in the electro-pop group World Class Wrecking Cru, mocking their effeminate dress. “It's hard to be believed how quickly a man can go from wearing makeup to puffin' on marijuana at barbecues," he spat. Eazy also included an image of Dre bedecked in heels and eyeliner to top it all off.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-nas-vs-jay-z>2. Nas vs. <a href=# class=text-word>Jay-Z</a></h2></span><p>INDIO, CA - APRIL 12: Rappers Nas (L) and Jay Z perform onstage during day 2 of the 2014 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival at the Empire Polo Club on April 12, 2014 in Indio, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for Coachella)</p><p>In the 90s, a disagreement between <a href=# rel>Jay-Z and Nas</a> seemed interminable. It all began with Nas not showing up for a Reasonable Doubt recording session but escalated when Nas rebuked him in his subsequent album. Following the death of Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z used this as an opportunity to challenge his authority in the New York City rap scene. The feud intensified further when Memphis Bleek reprimanded Nas, and Jay retaliated with "Takeover." Nas retaliated with the infamous diss track "Ether," which derided Jay's Roc-A-Fella collective. Jay-Z responded with "Supa Ugly," making this one of the most talked about hip hop beefs in the culture.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-tupac-shakur-vs-the-notorious-b-i-g>1. Tupac Shakur vs. The Notorious B.I.G.</h2></span><p>The historical animosity between <a href=# rel>Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G.</a> began in 1993 when they crossed paths—Biggie from Brooklyn and Pac representing Los Angeles. Unfortunately, tension hastily escalated when Pac was shot while traveling to record with Big in New York City. Later, Tupac accused him and Puff Daddy of involvement. This spurred a battle between East Coast's Bad Boy Records and West Coast's Death Row Records, escalating since 1991. Suge Knight stepped in, securing Pac a place at his L.A.-based label. Years later, Tha Dogg Pound also reignited the turmoil upon filming their music video for “New York, New York” back in the Big Apple. Up to today, Tupac Shakur vs. Biggie is considered one of the biggest hip hop beefs of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoR1hZdmmaKfl5rAtXnHoqdmoJ%2BleqOxxJ%2BqZqeWYq6tuIytoKad</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./call-of-the-void-why-do-we-feel-the-urge-to-jump-off-high-places.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Call of the void: why do we feel the urge to jump off high places?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-sopranos-top-10-best-episodes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;The Sopranos:&amp;quot; Top 10 Best Episodes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
