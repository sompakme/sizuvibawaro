The proposed class action seeks at least $1 million in back pay.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The complaint was filed amid a growing cost of living and <a href=#>poverty crisis</a> that has afflicted workers employed by major companies in the entertainment industry. A UCLA Labor Center study of Universal Studios Hollywood theme park employees found widespread poverty, with 44 percent of workers reporting that they worried about being evicted from their homes and more than half cutting the size of their meals — or skipping them altogether — because they do not have enough money for food. A quarter of the workforce has received benefits through food stamps, banks or other need-based donation programs.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">According to the complaint filed against Disney, the entertainment giant also failed to provide workers the proper rest and meal periods, as well as accurate wage statements to ensure they are being paid correctly, in a “willful and deliberate” manner.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The proposed class action was filed by assistant maintenance engineer Charlie Torres and seeks to represents a group of more than 115 current and former workers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Mr. Torres and so many others are told to cover the expense of tools used on behalf of Disney who flouts the law and refuses to pay its workers what they’re due,” said Ron Zambrano, a lawyer for the proposed class, in a statement. “Disney is a massive company. They know the law.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In December, a discrimination lawsuit against Disney accusing it of systematically underpaying women <a href=#>cleared a major hurdle</a> when a Los Angeles judge certified a diverse class of employees, who work across the company’s movie production arm, record labels, theme parks and home distribution subsidiaries, among other units. It’s believed to be one of the largest classes ever suing under an equal pay act claim. The group comprises women employed by Disney between April 2015 and three months before trial, which is set to start in October next year, below the level of vice president.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmnaGjo7K6ecKlmKyrXZawtbXOp2SlmaeowqrAjJ%2Bmq2WRobmms8SdZKWZkqS%2FbsLIqKOarJmku7R5x6irnqSjYn5zf5Rxa25taGl8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./evans-the-kidnapper-fresh-controversy-emerge-from-convict-s-court-session.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Evans the Kidnapper: Fresh Controversy Emerge From Convicts Court Session</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dianne-feinstein-net-worth-2023-a-reflective-journey-through-her-long-and-impactful-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dianne Feinstein Net Worth 2023: A Reflective Journey Through Her Long and Impactful Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
