It is also an opportunity to set time aside to reflect on your life and to make plans for the next year.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/98c2054f0f6cb9c0.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ wedding vows for him: Find the right words for your special day</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Legit.ng journalist contacted <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Adetola Seedy</a>, the lead pastor of Peace Church Global in Canada, to share his thoughts and opinions on the significance of these prayers for one's life:</p>I believe prayers should be said daily because it helps us get closer to God and gives us victory in our affairs. Based on this, I think it makes sense to pray even on our birthdays, because the bible instructs us to pray without ceasing (1Thessalonians 5:17). The general idea is that we are committing our new start to God and seeking His help to make it a successful journey. For people who are disciplined enough to always pray with fervency and desire, they always enjoy victory, regardless of the date on the calendar.<p class=align-left>Pastor Seedy further explained that there is no wisdom in praying only on special days but every believer must take responsibility for his/her (spiritual) life and consistently pray over oneself.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1c15dd26d3ef6730.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ happy birthday wishes for a male friend to send to your bro</span></p></a><h3>Christian birthday prayers for myself</h3><p class=align-left>These birthday prayers and blessings should be the first things you say on that particular day.</p><ul><li>God, you gave me a life that day I was born, and I hope I will spend all my life and do as much as I can to show you my love and gratitude!</li><li>Through all these years, God, I feel your love and care.
