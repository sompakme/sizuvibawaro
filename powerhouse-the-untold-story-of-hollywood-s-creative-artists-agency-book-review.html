It is elegantly produced — the jacket paper is thick enough to withstand an <span data-scayt_word=IED data-scaytid=1>IED</span> — and prefaced by an impressive list of 516 named “Featured Players,” intended, presumably, to make the reader assume that James Andrew Miller has interviewed all of them (it turns out that most are just mentioned in the text). The shame of it all is that it could have been an important book; its ambition rivals that of its subject, but unfortunately, it is not as successful.</p><p>Books are tricky creatures. Writers think they have all the space in the world, but every subject has an internal rhythm that dictates a suitable length, and they ignore it at their own risk. Worse, Powerhouse has no index, which is infuriating in a 700-page book that is repetitive and too often confusing. The reader has to be really enthralled by <span data-scayt_word=CAA data-scaytid=2><a href=# id=auto-tag_caa data-tag=caa>CAA</a></span> to get through it; there are stretches of story examined in such granular detail, that are so deadening, they make <span data-scayt_word=Ambien data-scaytid=3>Ambien</span> seem like a pick-me-up.&nbsp;</p><p><span class="lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-brand-primary lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-display-block">The Bottom Line</span> <span class="c-span u-font-size-22@tablet u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-family-secondary">Too much of a not-good-enough thing.</span></p><p>Miller does deserve credit for doing something that no one has been able to do: crack the code of the secret society that is <span data-scayt_word=CAA data-scaytid=4>CAA</span>, somehow getting all the principals, with the exception of Bryan <span data-scayt_word=Lourd data-scaytid=6>Lourd</span>, to talk frankly about the DNA that built the agency out of nothing and turned it into the entertainment industry’s most formidable — yes, powerhouse — in just five years, crushing the competition and virtually monopolizing the talent. Here is Mike <span data-scayt_word=Ovitz data-scaytid=7>Ovitz</span>, once the “most powerful man in Hollywood,” unplugged. He is the Caesar of this drama — or perhaps its Richard III, depending on whom you believe — while everyone Miller interviewed seems to agree that the hero, its Brutus, is his close friend Ron Meyer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Powerhouse essentially is an oral history that features a who’s who of boldfaced Hollywood names, like Martin <span data-scayt_word=Scorsese data-scaytid=9>Scorsese</span>, Tom Cruise, Bill Murray, David Letterman, Tom Hanks, Goldie <span data-scayt_word=Hawn data-scaytid=10>Hawn</span>, Sylvester <span data-scayt_word=Stallone data-scaytid=11>Stallone</span>, Joel Silver, Tom <span data-scayt_word=Pollock data-scaytid=12>Pollock</span> and Dustin Hoffman, as well as scores of agents both inside and outside of <span data-scayt_word=CAA data-scaytid=8>CAA</span>, whose names will be meaningless to the general reader. Displaying a taste for whimsy, Miller even includes fixer Anthony <span data-scayt_word=Pellicano data-scaytid=14>Pellicano</span>, the real-life Ray Donovan, who was sentenced to a long term in prison (recently vacated) in 2008.</p><p>ass,” but the town’s rivals and players (including Michael Ovitz) reveal the truth is far more complex in James Andrew Miller’s new book ‘Powerhouse: The Untold Story of Hollywood’s Creative Artists Agency.'”]</p><p>The book covers the rise of <span data-scayt_word=CAA data-scaytid=15>CAA</span>, when the five founders left the sclerotic William Morris Agency in 1975; the fall, if it can be called that, when Meyer and <span data-scayt_word=Ovitz data-scaytid=17>Ovitz</span> left in 1995; and the resurrection, led by the so-called Young Turks who, continuing in <span data-scayt_word=Ovitz’s data-scaytid=22>Ovitz’s</span> footsteps, transformed <span data-scayt_word=CAA data-scaytid=16>CAA</span> from a talent agency into a multi-armed octopus with tentacles in everything from banking to sports.</p><p>Miller identifies the unique approach adopted by <span data-scayt_word=CAA data-scaytid=23>CAA</span> that contributed to its stunning success: a one-for-all-and-all-for-one spirit of cooperation within the agency that differed dramatically from the rigid, hierarchical, compartmentalized William Morris, combined with a ferocious, take-no-prisoners attitude toward the competitors. <span data-scayt_word=Ovitz data-scaytid=24>Ovitz</span> famously used military metaphors to refer to his agents, describing them as “soldiers.” &nbsp;</p><p>There are plenty of gems buried in the avalanche of words, among them a funny story about Ali <span data-scayt_word=MacGraw data-scaytid=27>MacGraw</span>, with whom Meyer was having an affair, walking out on him because he wouldn’t get off the phone with a client.</p><p>The most Shakespearean, and therefore the most riveting parts of this tale, concern the ways in which success, money and power corrupted the ideals of the founders. Disabused agents repeatedly charge <span data-scayt_word=Ovitz data-scaytid=28>Ovitz</span> with concealing information, lying and cheating them. No one knew, for example, that <span data-scayt_word=Ovitz data-scaytid=29>Ovitz</span> and Meyer had their own plane. Recalls David “Doc” O’Connor, one of the Young Turks: “I remember getting on the plane and seeing matches that said ‘<span data-scayt_word=Ovitz data-scaytid=30>Ovitz</span>‘ on them and I said, ‘Hey, Mike, is this your plane?’ And he said, ‘No, no, no. They just put that stuff out there because I’m a frequent customer.’”</p><p><span data-scayt_word=CAA data-scaytid=35>CAA</span> was so successful that eventually it banged its head against the ceiling. <span data-scayt_word=Ovitz data-scaytid=36>Ovitz</span> once said, when he was asked if he’d like to take over a studio, “I don’t have to run a studio, I run them all now anyway.” And again, near the end of his tenure there, he complained, “There wasn’t anybody really left to sign.”</p><p>Ultimately, the close, almost fraternal relationship between <span data-scayt_word=Ovitz data-scaytid=39>Ovitz</span> and Meyer became a casualty of this success. Meyer took the job heading Universal that <span data-scayt_word=Ovitz data-scaytid=40>Ovitz</span> thought belonged to him, while <span data-scayt_word=Ovitz data-scaytid=41>Ovitz</span> bought the land on which Meyer was going to build his dream house. Both men speak candidly about their relationship.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Unfortunately, the book’s greatest asset — its worm’s eye view of the <span data-scayt_word=CAA data-scaytid=46>CAA</span> saga — is perhaps its greatest weakness. In the introduction, Miller asserts that <span data-scayt_word=“CAA data-scaytid=50>“CAA</span> has played a major role in transforming the entertainment business and the media in general,” but the book never tells us how; the author never zooms back to give us the big picture. In 1980, after only five years in existence, <span data-scayt_word=Ovitz data-scaytid=47>Ovitz</span> announced that his ambition was to “own the ’80s.” He succeeded, but discounting the filmmakers who survived the talent die-off at the end of the ‘<span data-scayt_word=70s data-scaytid=52>70s</span>, only a handful of really gifted directors emerged in the following decade, along with a precious few great films (Blade Runner, Salvador, Diner, Blue Velvet, et al). The ‘<span data-scayt_word=80s data-scaytid=55>80s</span> were a dismal decade, <span data-scayt_word=hammocked data-scaytid=56>hammocked</span> between the New Hollywood of the ‘<span data-scayt_word=70s data-scaytid=53>70s</span> and the explosion of independents in the ‘<span data-scayt_word=90s data-scaytid=58>90s</span>. The reasons for this are legion, but <span data-scayt_word=CAA data-scaytid=54>CAA</span> bares its share of the blame. To be fair, it did have a hand in outstanding shows like Twin Peaks and Thelma and Louise, but by driving star salaries through the roof, it forced the studios to respond by protecting their investments with mega-budget hi-concept blockbusters. <span data-scayt_word=CAA data-scaytid=60>CAA</span> did change the business, but not necessarily for the better.</p><p>Peter <span data-scayt_word=Biskind data-scaytid=62>Biskind</span>, a film historian and author of books including Easy Riders, Raging Bulls&nbsp;and Down and Dirty Pictures, is a contributing editor to Vanity Fair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSrnaaesri%2FjqmmsJ2inby2v8RmrKesn6Gxbr%2FTqKmyZZikua3F1qimnatdmL%2BmrdOirZ5laWaGeICRaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-gcse-grade-boundaries-revealed-for-aqa-edexcel-ocr-wjec-ccea-exams.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>2023 GCSE grade boundaries revealed for AQA, Edexcel, OCR, WJEC, CCEA exams</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./youtuber-arrested-for-helicopter-and-lamborghini-fireworks-stunt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>YouTuber arrested for helicopter and Lamborghini fireworks stunt</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./elvis-presley-steamroller-blues-l.html>Elvis Presley Steamroller Blues l</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./virgin-river-season-5-everything-we-know.html>'Virgin River' Season 5: Everything We Know</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celine-dion-shares-touching-behind-the-scenes-video-that-moves-fans.html>Celine Dion shares touching behind-the-scenes video that moves fans</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dee-dee-davis-net-worth-2024.html>Dee Dee Davis Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ethan-wacker-net-worth.html>Ethan Wacker Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveBlog.
