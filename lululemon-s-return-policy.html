This means that you have up to 30 days from the date of purchase to return or exchange an item for a full refund.&nbsp;</p><p>To initiate a return or exchange, you must provide proof of purchase, and the item must be in its original condition. All the tags and packaging must also still be attached.</p><p>You may return or exchange purchases in-store or by mail.</p><h2><span id=In-Store_Returns>In-Store Returns</span></h2><p>If you choose to&nbsp;<strong>return or exchange your Lululemon purchase in-store</strong>, you can do so at any Lululemon store location. In-store returns and exchanges are usually processed quickly, and you can receive your refund or exchange immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, you may also be offered the option to receive store credit, which can be used toward the purchase of a new item at a later date.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/In-Store-Returns-1.png alt="In-Store Returns" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span id=Online_Returns>Online Returns</span></h2><p>If you prefer to&nbsp;<strong>return or exchange your Lululemon purchase online</strong>, you can do so by visiting the Lululemon website and filling out the return form. Online returns are usually processed within 7–10 business days of receiving the item.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the return is processed, you can choose to get a store credit or a refund to the original method of payment.</p><h2><span id=Like-New_Returns>Like-New Returns</span></h2><p>Lululemon also sells items that are “like new.” These items have been gently worn or used but are still in good condition. Like-new items are usually very clean. They are also generally free of any stains or odors. Often, they also include all the original tags and packaging.&nbsp;</p><h3><span id=Good_news>Good news!</span></h3><p>Like-new items are also covered by the store’s 30-day return policy and can be returned or exchanged for a full refund or store credit.</p><h2><span id=Performance_Returns>Performance Returns</span></h2><p>After the 30-day return period has ended, you can still return or exchange items through&nbsp;<strong>Lululemon’s Performance Return program</strong>. This program allows you to return items that have been gently worn or used but no longer meet your needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Performance returns can be made virtually anytime, but the items that are turned in must be in good condition and free of any stains or odors.&nbsp;</p><p>You will receive store credit for the item, which can only be used towards the purchase of another Lululemon product.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Performance-Returns.png alt="Performance Returns" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span id=Trade-Ins>Trade-Ins</span></h3><p>Lululemon offers trade-ins for certain items that are in good condition.
