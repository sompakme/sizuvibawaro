Most people already living in the capital have their ideal hot-spots that they'd love to live - some already feel attached to where they are.</p><p>MyLondon set out to ask five people in their 20s where they'd love to live in London if they could choose anywhere and why? Chelsea perhaps? Or <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Shoreditch</a>? Do people like the boujee cafes or the edgy vibes - here's what they had to say.</p><p><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>MyLondon</a> managed to track down American actor Jamie Bogyo who recently starred in the <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>West End</a> musical - Moulin Rouge, playing the main role - Christian for over a year. As an expat in the UK, living up his dream, Jamie indulged us with his dream choice of places to live in London.</p><p><b>READ MORE - </b><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>The super cool neighbourhood that might just be the best place to live in London in your 20s</a></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article25698054.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_IMG_7160.jpg><p>Currently living around Ladbroke Grove, Jamie confirmed he liked West London: "If money was no object I would love to live in Notting Hill - but I also love Islington too."</p><p>The actor continued: "I'm a big fan of the brunch vibe, artisanal food shopping, boutique stores and art house cinemas - anywhere like that and I am sold." Originally from New York, Jamie moved to London when he was accepted into RADA. Having been in the UK for over six years, he said: "London feels like home, I love it here."</p><p>But what about people from the UK - Hannah Lennie has lived in London for the past three years, starting off in Shepherds Bush before moving to Balham. Hannah said: "I like anywhere with green spaces. Balham is great because you're close to three commons and it's on the <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Northern line</a> and super easy to get in to town."</p><p>On where she could live if she wanted to, Hannah confessed: "I actually love Crystal Palace. We're trying to find somewhere at the moment but the renting market is just so difficult right now. I feel like because it's so hard and I just want to move there- that is my dream place."</p><p>Frankie Starr works in the train and rail industry, but already has her life on track. Living in the borough of Wandsworth, Frankie is right where she want's to be.</p><p>"This might sound really beige but <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Clapham Common</a> area," she said. "Clapham has everything you need, good tube and overground links, bars and restaurants and of course the common. I lived by the common during lockdown and it became a special place to meet loved ones as the restrictions eased so I have a lot of good memories there. It also has a direct line home to see family in Sussex."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article25698132.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_7162.jpg><p>Clapham does offer good transport links to the south whilst offering a little haven away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Junior psychiatrist for the <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>NHS</a>, William Barber, has been living and studying in London for a year and a half - currently residing in Kennington - a place he really loves. William's view was very logical and had two different ideal locations.</p><p>He explained: "I think Bermondsey or <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Croydon</a>. Two very different places for different reasons.</p><p>"Bermondsey because it's close to London Bridge, so it's easy to get around and close to the Thames and has tower bridge. I feel like it's a nice area with more safety compared to other places and it's close to cool restaurants and bars."</p><p>William also explained London didn't really feel like home for him and that sometimes it get's a bit too intense. The NHS worker added: "I want to move out of London when I can to be fair - being amongst it isn’t going to be good for my health long term. Croydon is well connected for work - I wouldn't mind living a bit further out."</p><p>Studying at Wembley Kieran Roy is hoping to move into the city once he graduates and has his eye on South West London. He explained: "I reckon if I could live anywhere in London I’d probably go with Clapham or the area around it.</p><p>He added: "It’s easy to get into central London from there and from what I’ve heard from friends who live there the nightlife is pretty good. It’s also relatively near to Stamford Bridge which is another plus as a Chelsea fan. If not Clapham I’d go with <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Camden</a> for similar reasons to be honest."</p><p>The people have spoken - well five of them - and have chosen five different places. Clapham is obviously still a popular destination for young people to settle, but there are many options to chose from - depending on what lifestyle you want.</p><p><b>Want more from MyLondon?
