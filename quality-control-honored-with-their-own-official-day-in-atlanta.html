What they’ve done in Atlanta set a standard that allowed a new generation of artists to come into the game. Atlanta is home to some of the greatest rappers of all time. However, not every label that emerged from the city saw the same success as Quality Control. Kevin “Coach K” Lee and Pierre “P” Thomas transformed bubbling local rappers into the biggest success stories in rap. To this day, they continue to do so while expanding well beyond the realms of the A.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Today, the city of Atlanta honored the label with its very own day. City officials dubbed March 15th, 2023 “QC Day” in the city. On the label’s official Instagram page, they shared a letter from State Representative Park Cannon who commended Lee and Thomas. “You have been chosen to be honored on QC Day because you have worked diligently at your craft and brought millions of dollars in revenue along with notoriety to the City of Atlanta,” the letter reads. “As State Representative, I am elated at the opportunity to recognize your hard work in the Georgia State House Of Representatives.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-quality-control-day-in-atlanta>Quality Control Day In Atlanta</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The news of QC Day in Atlanta comes a few weeks after Hybe acquired Quality Control in a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">$300M deal</a>. However, Lee and Thomas will continue to have full control and creative direction of the company. “P and I are ecstatic about this partnership with Scooter and Hybe and are confident they can get us to our global ambitions we’ve had in our scope since the beginning of the company as nothing means more than our artists impacting worldwide,” Lee said in a statement. “Over many years, Scooter and I have cultivated real trust and a common way of looking at the world and culture.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Quality Control launched in 2013 with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Migos</a> leading their roster. The group’s relationship with the label became strained in recent times due to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Offset’s lawsuit against QC</a>. However, they’ve expanded with the signing of artists like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Baby</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Yachty</a>, and the City Girls. They also boast Solid Foundation Management branch, which manages artists like Trippie Redd. With the new deal with Hybe, and their official day in Atlanta, there’s no telling where Quality Control will head in the next decade.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
