According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) guidelines, passengers are allowed to bring curling irons in their carry-on luggage. However, it’s important to note that there are certain regulations and safety precautions that you need to keep in mind when traveling with a curling iron.</p><p>It is recommended to pack your curling iron in a way that it is easily accessible for security screening.
